      "text": "**1. Introduction** With the urgent need to reduce the emissions of fossil fuels, energy storage is going\nto play a key role in the future of transportation and grid services. Within all the known\nstorage solutions, intercalation batteries appear to be good candidates for the task despite\nsome durability and safety concerns. Li-ion battery aging is path-dependent [1,2] and\ndistinct degradation mechanisms could be inhibited or exacerbated by different stress\nfactors. This could drastically affect reliability and adds a lot of complexity to onboard\ndiagnosis and prognosis. A possible way to handle this complexity is to use artificial\nintelligence (AI), a technique that has shown tremendous potential for improving energy\nstorage materials [1] as well as diagnosis and prognosis [3\u20135]. For the latter, the primary\nchallenge area is that the training data is, in most cases, not representative of the projected\nusage and thus does not encompass the sporadic spectrum of degradation that can occur\nin the field [4,6]. This might render the proposed algorithms inapplicable in deployed\nsystems. Due to the cost associated with the gathering of experimental data, most studies\nthat employ AI for commercial cell diagnosis or prognosis only used training datasets with\nunder 20 samples which is not enough. Among the outliers [6\u201314], Severson et al. [6,12,15]\ntested 124 different conditions, although only varied the charging parameters and did not\nperform any reference performance testing.\nWhile the growing online databases [6,16\u201321] and the newly proposed Battery Data\nGenome [22] are providing steps in the right direction, they are still vastly insufficient to\nprovide enough data to cover the changes that could be associated with small differences in\nduty cycle [23]. This path dependence of deployed systems is a determining aspect for the\nvalidation of online diagnosis and prognosis tools [24,25] and is the largest knowledge gap\nin scientific data for the AI community. To circumvent this issue, we proposed the use of\nsynthetic cycling data [26] to complement existing datasets and accelerate the development\nof new and unique data-driven tools by providing the community with supplementary\ndata on a wider array of degradation paths.\nThis publication is building on our previous methodological work [26] where we used\nthe mechanistic modeling approach [27\u201330] to generate a proof of concept dataset for a _Energies_ **2021**, _14_ [, 2371. https://doi.org/10.3390/en14092371](https://doi.org/10.3390/en14092371) [https://www.mdpi.com/journal/energies](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/energies)",

In this work, we refined the technique and\nwill be offering updated datasets with five times more resolution and for additional battery\nchemistries. We synthesized data for a Gr//LFP cell at C/25, as an update of our previous\ndataset, for a Gr//Nickel Aluminum Cobalt Oxide (NCA) cell, and for a Gr//Nickel\nManganese Cobalt Oxide (NMC811) cell at C/30 and C/25, respectively [31\u201334]. In addition\nto the data synthesis, we also performed a statistical analysis of the results to address early\nprognosability and proposed meaningful learnable parameters [15] in order to provide\nphysical and statistical interpretability, another significant challenge areas for AI algorithms.\nFor this purpose, we investigated the correlation of various features of interest (FOI) with\nstate of health (SOH) [24].\nA recent prospective study [22] highlighted different challenge problems necessary\nto accelerate the impact of AI methods on the battery field. This work is addressing tier 1\nchallenges. We believe our synthetic cycles can be used for diagnosis, for the determination\nof the minimum number of cycles to predict cycle life, and to address how well predictions\ncan transfer from one technology to the other. In this work, degradation is defined as\nchanges in loss of lithium inventory (LLI) and/or loss of active material (LAM). Diagnosis\nwill be defined as a single point estimation of capacity loss, LLI, and LAM on the positive\nand negative electrodes (PE and NE, respectively) without prior information. SOH and\nprognosis will be referencing to the remaining useful life determination (i.e., how many\nmore cycles before 20% capacity loss) and not the evolution of capacity loss. This is to take\ninto consideration the second stage of battery degradation [6,23,35\u201339]. **2. Materials and Methods**\n_2.1. Half-Cell Data_",

      "text": "**2. Materials and Methods**\n_2.1. Half-Cell Data_ The voltage response of commercial cells was reconstructed using half-cell data from\nPE and NE. The commercial cells used for this study were comprehensively studied in\nprevious work. The Gr//NCA cell was based on the Panasonic 3350 mAh NCR 18650B\nbatteries studied in [35,40\u201343]. The Gr//NMC811 cell was based on the PE from a SamsungSDI 3500 mAh INR18650-35E battery [44] and a stock NE, and the Gr//LFP cell was based\non an A123 2300 mAh ANR26650M battery [23,45]. Interested readers are referred to the\noriginal publications for more details. Since all the cells are using a Gr NE, they will be\nreferred to by their PE only in the rest of this work.\nBefore being opened in an Argon-filled glove box, all the batteries were discharged to\na 0% state of charge (SOC) [46]. Electrode discs (18 mm in diameter) were then punched\nand rinsed in a dimethyl carbonate (DMC) solution. N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) was\nused to wipe the backside of the electrodes. The electrodes were tested on a multi-channel\nBio-Logic VMP3 potentiostat (Bio-Logic, Claix, France) against a lithium counter electrode\nwith a 1.0 M LiPF6 in ethylene carbonate + DMC (1:1 by weight) and 2% wt. vinylene\ncarbonate electrolyte as well as one Whatman GF-D fiberglass disc (12.7 mm in diameter,\nWhatman, Kent, UK) as a separator. The complete testing protocol can be found in [46]. _2.2. Simulations_ The synthetic voltage vs. capacity curves concept was extensively described in [26]\nand will not be repeated in detail here. In our approach, we use experimental data\nfor the PE and NE to reconstruct the electrochemical behavior of full cells aged under\ndifferent degradation scenarios without the need for electrochemical equations [27\u201330].\nBoth electrodes are matched with a loading ratio (LR) that corresponds to the capacity ratio\nbetween the electrodes and an offset (OFS) that corresponds to their slippage, along with\nresistance and kinetic adjustments if necessary [30], Table A1.\nWith degradation, LR and OFS are predictably affected by the LAMs and LLI [30]. Using this knowledge, the LAMs and LLI can be varied and the projected changes of LR and\nOFS, and thus the full-cell electrochemical response, can be calculated without the need for\nknowledge of the conditions leading to this degradation.

      "text": "_Energies_ **2021**, _14_, 2371 3 of 24 5000 combinations of LAMs and LLI were computed, each up to 85% of each degradation\nmode with 0.85% intervals [26]. To better visualize the impact of the degradation, only the\nC/25 charges were calculated. This is equivalent to performing a reference performance\ntest at a given SOH and at room temperature. In addition, to test different duty cycles,\nmore than 125,000 different evolutions of LAMs and LLI values were calculated from predetermined equations involving linear and exponential evolution for each degradation mode,\ndelayed exponential acceleration for LLI, and different reversibilities for lithium plating\n(see Appendix A). Since the publication of our proof-of-concept synthetic datasets [26],\nwe and others have utilized the data for different purposes and found that some of the\nfeatures could be improved. This publication addresses some of the improvements.\nThe initial datasets provided 201 points for each voltage vs. capacity (V vs. Q) curve\n(1 point every 0.5% capacity) and the step was set at 0.85% of each degradation mode.\nThis proved problematic to simulate early cycles for duty cycles with low degradation. In\nsuch cases, multiple cycles were using the same V vs. Q curve leading to the prediction\nof no voltage variations and constant capacity. To solve the problem, the resolution of the\ndata was increased to 0.1% capacity (1001 points per voltage vs. capacity curves) and the\nstep for the degradation was changed to non-constant with a resolution multiplied by 10\nbetween 0 and 2% degradation, by 4 between 2.25% and 5%, and by 2 between 5 and 15%\ndegradation. Overall, this added 38 simulations per path which increased the number of\nV vs. Q curves in the V vs. Q matrix by almost 200,000 to more than 700,000.\nIncreasing the number of points by 500% and the number of simulations by 35%\nincreased the size of the V vs. Q matrix from roughly 500 MB to 6 GB. This was later\nhalved by changing the floating-point numbers precision from double to single. This did\nnot alter the quality of the data since only three decimals are needed to reach the mV\nresolution of the initial half-cell data. The increase in the number of points per voltage\ncurve was however more problematic for the duty cycle dataset which contained more\nthan 3,000,000 V vs. Q curves (>125,000 duty cycles with one V vs. Q curve every 100 cycles\nfor 3000 cycles) and was already above 3 GB in the proof-of-concept data. This issue was\nsolved by pushing our initial concept further. As explained in [26], and to avoid lengthy\ncalculation time, the duty cycle data was not calculated but harvested from the V vs. Q\nmatrix by finding the V vs. Q curve with the closest mix of LLI and LAMs to the one to\nsimulate. In the new version of the duty cycle matrix, only the index of the V vs. Q curve is\nharvested which precludes the need for a large array and reduced the dataset size from\n3 GB to only 15 MB for 125,000 duty cycles. This now allows to simulate duty cycle datasets\ntwo orders of magnitude larger for the same file size. In this work, we limited the new\ndata to an increase of the cycle resolution by offering data with 10-cycle intervals up to\n200 cycles. Coupled with the higher resolution of the voltage vs. capacity curves, this\nallows to visualize well-defined changes early in the duty cycle prediction, an essential\nfeature for early prognosis. This should offer more possibilities for the development of\nearly prognosis tools. All the datasets synthesized in this work are freely available for\ndownload [31\u201334].",

The chosen FOIs, Figure 2c, accurately tracked the changes in the IC curve as FOI1\nincreased before decreasing, FOI2 and FOI4 decreased, and FOI3 and FOI5 increased.\nHowever, it must be noted that FOI4 lost accuracy after 2200 cycles. This is because of its\ndefinition; FOI3 was defined as the maximum intensity between a limited potential range\n(3 and 3.25 V, Table A3) in order to catch the intensity of peak _\u20dd_ 5 without englobing peak _\u20dd_ 4 . With the increase of the polarization, the peak was shifted to a potential larger than\n3.25 V and its intensity can therefore no longer be tracked. This is a common limitation\nfor FOI tracking and it needs to be taken into consideration when choosing learnable\nparameters [24]. This highlights that more work is needed for automated FOI tracking. In\nthis work, we hope to avoid this issue as much as possible by focusing our effort on the\ndiagnosis and early prognosis based on cycles 10, 50, 100, 200, 400, and 1000. _3.1. FOI vs. Diagnosis_",

      "text": "_3.1. FOI vs. Diagnosis_ Based on our previous studies on the commercial cells used in this work [23,35,40\u201345],\nsome FOIs were already established to provide good a diagnosis over the tested experimental conditions. For the LFP cell, FOI1 was shown to be sensitive to LLI and LAMNE,\nand FOI2 changes were found to be correlated to LAMNE. For the NCA and NMC811 cells,\nFOI1 was shown to be representative of LAMPE and FOI4 of LAMNE. Using the synthetic\ncycles, the potential of those FOIs over a wider range of conditions can be tested.\nAs expected [24], although they were valid choices in the aforementioned studies, their\napplicability for diagnosis cannot be extended to all the possible aging conditions. Table 1\nsummarizes the correlation coefficient between the different FOIs and the percentage of\nLLI, LAMPE, LAMNE, and the capacity loss at cycle 100 for the LFP cell. Figure 3 showcases\nthe associated evolution of the most adapted FOI for all four components of the diagnosis\nat cycle 100 for each duty cycle. As expected, FOI1 is sensitive to both LLI and LAMNE with\nPearson correlation coefficients \u03c1 of _\u2212_ 0.74 and 0.62. It also has a relatively high correlation\nwith capacity loss ( _\u2212_ 0.72) which is not surprising since capacity loss is usually induced by\nLLI [25] in graphite-based cells. However, even if the correlation is rather high, Figure 3a,d\nshowcases that FOI1 cannot be used for LLI or capacity loss diagnosis as the distribution\nis broad (close to _\u00b1_ 10% around the average). For LAMNE, while all FOIs have absolute\ncorrelation coefficients with LAMNE above 0.6, FOI2 is, as expected, the best choice with\na correlation coefficient of _\u2212_ 0.99, Figure 3c. For LAMPE, the best FOI seemed to be FOI3\nwith a \u03c1 equal to _\u2212_ 0.36 but Figure 3b showcases that the peak voltage shift was small, and\nthat sub millivolt accuracy would be necessary to take advantage of this FOI.",

However, the\ncorrelation coefficients are much higher (\u03c1 > 0.9) for duty cycles with a high LLI ratio.\nThe lowest coefficients are observed for duty cycles with high ratios of LAMPE or LAMNE.\nThe difference between our results and the literature [6,12] could be explained by the\nbroader testing conditions but also by the difference in rate. Our results were obtained\nfrom C/25 charges whereas 4C discharges were used in the literature [6,12]. At 4C, changes\nin polarization will induce more changes than at C/25 which would likely change the\ncorrelation. Similar results can be observed for the three other tested parameters. Overall,\nstrait capacity loss is the best indicator closely followed by the variance between cycle\n100 and cycle 1. It has to be noted that the correlation coefficients for the capacity loss are\nhigher than reported in the literature for smaller datasets (~0.5) [73,74]. **4. Discussion**\n_4.1. Diagnosis_",

      "text": "**4. Discussion**\n_4.1. Diagnosis_ The diagnosis obtained by using the method proposed in [24] could be considered\nsuccessful with average errors almost all below 1% when tested on more than 125,000 duty\ncycles, up to 1000 cycles and on three chemistries. Compared to our previous work [26],\na better definition of the FOI for the LFP cell improved the LAMPE estimation but this\ndiagnosis will always be difficult for LFP cells because of the flat voltage response. LAMPE\nestimation is much easier for NCA and NMC811. This work pushed the analysis of the\nresults deeper than in [26] and the standard deviations were studied on various subsets of\nthe entire degradation path matrix from high LLI to high LAMPE and LAMNE ratios or a\nmix of everything. It was found that slightly lower standard deviations were observed for\nhigh LLI as well as high LAMPE for LFP and NMC811 and high LAMPE for NCA, although\nthe differences were small at cycle 100. At cycle 400, the standard deviations are higher\nand the differences between the different degradation mixes are more visible. Overall, the\nmethod can be considered robust and applicable to multiple chemistries. _4.2. Early Prognosis_ For early prognosis, this study confirmed our previous observations [26] that some of\nthe proposed learnable parameters might not be valid on the entire spectrum of possible\ndegradations. Surprisingly, the best indicator overall seems to be simply the capacity loss\nbut the correlation is still much lower than needed (\u03c1 ~ 0.6\u20130.8) to have full confidence in the\nearly prognosis. However, a closer analysis showed that the correlation is highly dependent\non the mix of degradation and that degradation with a high share of LLI seems to be more\npredictable using the proposed learnable parameters or capacity loss (\u03c1 ~ 0.8\u20130.9). This\nhighlights that the synthetic cycles are offering information that would be difficult to obtain\nexperimentally. It could also be argued that they might have the opposite problem than that",

However, the technique is still young, and the equations used to generate\nthe duty cycles could be tuned to reflect more real life, especially since the improved\napproach for duty cycle generation now allows to simulate more cycles. The results of the\nexperimental design proposed as the Tier 2 challenge of the battery data genome [22] as\nwell as access to more field data would be invaluable to define limits on the conditions to\nscan. In the meantime, we still believe our synthetic cycles are a transformative solution to\nprospect for meaningful early diagnosis and prognosis indicators, whether for statistical or\ndeep-learning data-driven methods.\nWith our diagnosis approach showcasing promising results, a possible solution for\nearly prognosis could be to use the diagnosis at different early cycles to extrapolate the\nevolution of LLI and the LAMs individually to reconstruct the voltage curves using the\nmechanistic approach (see SI in [26]).

In\nthe dataset provided in [6], the capacity loss is associated with LLI at a linear rate of about\n0.005% per cycle. The acceleration of the degradation was associated with LAMNE. The fact\nthat the acceleration is delayed for most cells suggests that LAMNE is just slightly higher\nthan LLI. Moreover, since no evidence of peak 0 _\u20dd_ was reported, the lithium plating can\nbe considered 100% irreversible. There was also no suggestion of any impact of the PE.\nIn addition, the tested rate was 4C, far higher than our C/25.

Conclusions** In this work, the strategy for the generation of synthetic datasets was refined to\nincrease the resolution of the data to 1001 points for each voltage vs. capacity curve\ncompared to 201 in the previous iteration, a fivefold increase. Moreover, changes in the\nduty cycle generation process allowed to reduce the size of the dataset by a factor of 200\nif the diagnosis dataset is attached. This enables to increase the number of simulated\nduty cycles by two orders of magnitude without reaching the variable size limitation for\nMATLAB\u00a9 on a normal laptop. In addition to improvements in the synthetic duty cycle\ngeneration and an update on the LFP dataset, we provided data for two other chemistries,\nNCA and NMC. These datasets provide the community with additional data to better\nvalidate diagnosis and prognosis tools on a wider array of possible degradations and they\ncould be used as a Tier 1 challenge for deep and statistical learning early prognosis in the\nBattery Data Genome.\nWe also performed a statistical analysis of the datasets. Our investigation showcased\nthat although a single FOI-based diagnosis is not effective, considering several FOIs together can offer accuracies below 1% up to cycle 400 for LLI, LAMPE, LAMNE, and capacity\nloss estimations. An extrapolation of this diagnosis allowed to prognose end-of-life with\naccuracies comparable with state-of-the-art for degradation paths with high LLI or LAMPE.\nIt also showcased that the diagnosability and the prognosability are highly dependent on\nthe degradation paths and that new methodologies must be validated on diverse datasets\nto be considered validated. **Author Contributions:** Conceptualization, M.D.; methodology, M.D.; software, M.D.; validation,\nM.D. and D.B.; formal analysis, M.D. and D.B.; investigation, M.D.; resources, M.D.; data curation,\nM.D.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, M.D.; writing\u2014review and editing, M.D. and D.B.; visualization, M.D.; supervision, M.D.; project administration, M.D.; funding acquisition, M.D. All authors\nhave read and agreed to the published version of the manuscript. **Funding:** This research was funded by the Office of Naval Research, grant number N00014-18-1-2127\nand N00014-19-1-2159.",

Since we are\nscanning all the possible LLI and LAMs combinations, our focus is set on how the cell is\ndegraded independently of how it got there. The duty cycle dataset was calculated by\nvarying eight parameters, Table A1. For all three degradation modes (LLI, LAMPE, and\nLAMNE, the degradation was chosen to follow Equation A1 where a and b corresponds to\nparameters _p1_ and _p2_ for LLI, _p3_, and _p4_ for LAMPE, and _p5_ and _p6_ for LAMNE. Parameter\n_p7_ addresses a delay for the exponential response for LLI. % _degradation_ = _a \u00d7 cycle_ + ( _exp_ _[b][\u00d7][cycle]_ _\u2212_ 1) (A1) The plating threshold (PT) [26,35] at which lithium plating starts to happen was\ncalculated using Equation (A2).
