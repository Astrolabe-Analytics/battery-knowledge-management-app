Offer** **\u2217,z** _Department of Mechanical Engineering, Imperial College London, South Kensington, London SW7 2AZ,_\n_United Kingdom_ Fast charging of batteries is currently limited, particularly at low temperatures, due to difficulties in understanding lithium plating.\nAccurate, online quantification of lithium plating increases safety, enables charging at speeds closer to the electrochemical limit\nand accelerates charge profile development. This work uses different cell cooling strategies to expose how voltage plateaus arising\nfrom cell self-heating and concentration gradients during fast charging can falsely indicate plating, contrary to prevalent current\nassumptions. A solution is provided using Differential Voltage (DV) analysis, which confirms that lithium stripping is observable.\nHowever, scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray analysis are used to demonstrate the inability of the plateau\ntechnique to detect plating under certain conditions. The work highlights error in conventional plating quantification that leads to the\ndangerous underestimation of plated amounts. A novel method of using voltage plateau end-point gradients is proposed to extend the\nsensitivity of the technique, enabling measurement of lower levels of lithium stripping and plating. The results are especially relevant\nto automotive OEMs and engineers wishing to expand their online and offline tools for fast charging algorithm development, charge\nmanagement and state-of-health diagnostics.\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2019.

Fast charging of lithium-ion batteries remains a priority amongst\nautomotive Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) that are electrifying their product portfolios. Consequently, there are increasingly\nlarge demands on time and monetary investment in the development\nof fast charging strategies, for which, the avoidance of lithium plating\nis a priority. However, the techniques available for inexpensive, nondestructive and fast plating identification and quantification are immature and contribute to the cost of development. Moreover, increased accuracy of plating assessments is required for improved online, Battery\nManagement System (BMS)-based diagnostics and charge strategy\nde-rating. Researchers also demand alternatives to destructive evaluation techniques. The instability of Li [0] coupled with the timeframe\nbetween plating and cell disassemly presents a major problem because\nex-situ observations may no longer be accurate. [1] During charging of a lithium-ion cell with a graphitic Negative\nElectrode (NE) the reversible lithium intercalation reaction proceeds\nin the reduction direction according to Equation 1 at the NE. Under\ncertain conditions, overpotential exceeding NE equilibrium potential\nor Li concentration saturation of the graphite, the competing lithium\nmetal deposition reaction additionally proceeds. It does so in the reduction direction according to Equation 2, inducing lithium plating\n(deposition). In this work, the phrase \u201cthe technique\u201d is used to refer to the practice\nof using the high voltage plateau to identify and/or quantify lithium\nplating and stripping. Throughout the technique\u2019s evolution from a\nqualitative to a quantitative tool, few works have addressed its accuracy and reliability or considered in full the difference between\nquantifying stripping and quantifying plating.

Throughout the technique\u2019s evolution from a\nqualitative to a quantitative tool, few works have addressed its accuracy and reliability or considered in full the difference between\nquantifying stripping and quantifying plating. [11] Moreover, the use of the technique for lithium plating identification\nalone is still not fully understood and is without consensus. The traditional belief that an absence of a plateau is indicative of an absence\nof plating [2][,][5] has been challenged, but remains unclear. The concern\nby Smart et al. [5] that Chemical Intercalation (CI) could result in a reduction or absence of Li [0] availability, and consequently the absence\nof a stripping plateau in spite of plating having occurred, has been\nreiterated. [12][\u2013][15] It has been suggested that the stripping current is dependent upon the areal coverage of lithium [16] and additionally, that\nthe area be of a minimum size for detection. [11][,][14] Following plating,\nthe interplay between CI, stripping and irreversible Loss of Lithium\nInventory (LLI) owing to parasitic reaction is acknowledged as complex, and requires further studies to develop the state of knowledge.\nThe technique has been nearly universally developed and studied\ni) under the conditions of slow charging where cell self-heating is\ninsubstantial and with cell temperature deviating little spatially and\nversus the ambient, and additionally, where solid-phase lithium concentration gradients are small, or ii) at ambient temperatures so low\nthat they are rarely applicable to Electric Vehicles (EVs). This development history has led to perpetuation of the theory that the technique\nfunctions only at temperatures of \u221220 [\u25e6] C and below. [13][,][14][,][16] However,\nthe discharge plateau technique\u2019s performance is arguably of greatest\ninterest to the automotive sector following fast charging, when the\npropensity to lithium plate is greater than following slow charging,\nand at temperatures more commonly encountered by EVs. A dearth\nof information exists under these conditions, as Table I demonstrates.\nThe majority of works given in Table I report only ambient\ntemperatures and neglect the difference relative to cell temperature.\nUhlmann,Illig,Ender,Schuster&Ivers-Tiff\u00e9einvestigatedplatingfollowing 10 C charge pulses at 23 [\u25e6] C, but via the alternative relaxation\ntechnique. [16] While works such as that by Tippmann, Walper, Balboa,\nSpier & Bessler have simulated the influence of cell self-heating on NE\npotential during charging, few have done so with a focus on the high\nvoltage plateau. [11][,][17] Yang, Ge, Liu, Leng, & Wang probed via simulation the influence of temperature on the voltage curves, again during\nrelaxation, for the same quantity of Li [0] . [11] Similarly, little attention has\nbeen afforded to the influence of instantaneous State of Charge (iSOC)",

Recently, it has been reported that\nwithout a reference electrode, plating detection via differential voltage\nanalysis is possible only when the Positive Electrode (PE) contributes\nnegligiblytothecellpotentialprofile,suchaswiththeuseofLiFePO4. [9]\nThis is in spite of the existence of works to the contrary demonstrating\nsuccessful use of the technique with mesocarbon microbead-Nickel\nCobalt (NC) [2] and graphite-Nickel Manganese Cobalt (NMC) [11] cells.\nIn this work, we investigate the technique\u2019s characteristics in light\nof high charge rates\u2014up to 9 _._ 1 mA _._ cm [\u2212][2], equivalent to 5 _._ 0 C\u2014at 0 [\u25e6] C.\nIn doing so, we highlight issues with the voltage plateau for plating\nidentification in the presence of high cell temperatures and steep solid\nphase concentration gradients associated with fast charging.

Secondly, the increased potential from\nlower impedance or high _c_ s [\u2217] [could be mistaken for a lithium stripping]\nplateau when no plating has occurred, constituting a false positive diagnostic result and possibly leading to premature cell replacement and\nadditional cost.\nFigure 3 presents results for the conduction cooling strategy only.\nHere, the highest cell surface temperature reached at the beginning of\ndischarge was 0 _._ 3 [\u25e6] C, immediately following 2 _._ 7 mA _._ cm [\u2212][2] charging.\nThe variation across all four fast charging rates was, at less than 0 _._ 2 [\u25e6] C,\nwell within measurement error and just 1 _._ 3% of the variation observed\nacross convection tests.

Two characteristics are prominent. Firstly, both\ncells show changes in thermodynamic behavior. Profile evolution\nthroughout the tests is evident, with the cell charged at the higher\nrate showing vastly more, owing to a greater degradation rate. Secondly, as illustrated in both insets, neither _Q_ d _V_ d _Q_ [\u2212][1] profile shows\nany newly-formed inflections to indicate the end of a lithium stripping\nplateau. Hence, despite the low ambient temperature, high charge current densities and evident degradation, the voltage plateau technique\nprovides no indication of lithium plating having occurred. For those\nmedium term test cycles sampled at the lower value of _f_ s = 1 Hz,\nthe influence of sampling period on the ability to detect inflections\nwas considered. Of the nine inflections recorded in this work\u2014all\nwith conductively cooled cells\u2014the minimum inflection duration was\n190 _._ 4 mAh, equivalent to just over 30 minutes of discharging time.\nHence, the inflection period is typically long relative to the sampling\nperiod. With the reduced _f_ s, approximately 1800 samples would be\nrecorded during an inflection, and the reduced _f_ s is sufficient to detect\nan inflection. Moreover, since the smoothing window is defined as a\npercentage of dataset length, smoothing was applied at the same level,\nirrespective of the sampling frequency used.\nHowever, other characteristics of the DV signatures provide a\ncontrasting indication on plating occurrence. In Figure 5b, a nearcomplete disappearance and rightward shift of trough 1, denoted with\nthe upward-facing red arrow, is observable. The curve experiences a\nmajority shift to lower cell SOC and the gradual disappearance of\ntrough 4. Trough 5 experiences a continuous shift to more negative\nvalues and also to lower cell SOC. In DV analysis, LLI manifests\nas a lateral shifting of the curves to lower values on the capacity\naxis. [26] However, after normalizing to the reference discharge capacity,\nmean discharge capacity across all cycles is 99 _._ 07% with a standard\ndeviation \u03c3 of 0 _._ 15%. Hence, the curves show very little movement at\nthe capacity axis intersection, indicating minimal capacity fade.\nIf EOC for lithium-ion cells is imposed by a _V_ max criterion, the rising PE potential is typically the limiter on charge added. In this work\nthe cell is always recharged to a capacity limit corresponding to 80%\nSOC and the same quantity of charge capacity is withdrawn from the\nPE, and made available for discharge, irrespective of cycle number.\nHowever, the galvanostatic charge phase end point is imposed by the\n_V_ max criterion. Figure 6a illustrates the quantities of charge added until\nthat end point for each of the two cells. A plot of time until _V_ max shows\na similar trend. For both cells, _V_ max is reached increasingly early in the\ncharge process with more cycles, as indicated by the negative slopes\nof both curves. Since the NE potential is relatively invariant at high\niSOC and the PE potential gradient strongly positive, the declining\nCC phase charge quantities indicate PE slippage (stoichiometric drift)\nin the direction illustrated in Figure 6b. The slippage suggests the occurrence of LLI. The cell with unity State of Health (SOH) is given\nin Figure 6b (i), where the vertical offset between bars represents the\nPE potential as the EOC limiter and the NE potential as the End of",

Preferential lithium\ndeposition at the electrode perimeter (the \u201cedge effect\u201d) is a widely acknowledged phenomenon, arising because of a tendency for the edge\u2019s\nLi concentration to rise faster than in the bulk of the sheet.

BMS implementation of the technique without\nthis consideration presents a large safety concern.\nInvestigation of the cause of this behavior will be the subject of\nfuture work. However, five possible explanations are introduced here.\nTheories i and ii are predicated on the basis that Li [0] deposition occurred with a reversible component, but that the subsequent stripping\nwas undetectable. i.e. stripping did occur. Theories iii to v are predicated on the alternative basis that, at the beginning of discharge, there\nwas no reversibly-plated Li [0] available and hence a dearth of reactant\nfor the stripping process. i.e. stripping did not occur. i) Minimum coverage threshold: The areal coverage of Li [0] on NE particles is below a\nminimum threshold required for detection. This is unlikely, because\nfollowing only a single fast charge of the conductively cooled cell E\n(1 _._ 8 mA _._ cm [\u2212][2], where the quantity of deposited Li [0] was likely much\nless than in cells MT1 or MT2), _Q_ d _V_ d _Q_ [\u2212][1] inflections emerged. ii)\nIncreased Li [0] oxidation potential: Variations in cell temperature have\nrecently been shown to influence plateau length during relaxation. [11]\nSimilarly,increasedtemperaturecanincreaseordecreasetheoxidation\npotential of Li [0] during cell discharge according to the Nernst equation,\nwhere the direction is defined by the sign of the reaction quotient. In\ndoing so, the mixed potential could be adjusted upward to more a positive potential with respect to Li/Li [+], closer to the singular potential\nof oxidation by Equation 1. Hence, the stripping plateau\u2019s departure\nfrom the normal terminal voltage profile is less. It is conceivable that\nit is so much less that no plateau is detected. iii) Reaction reversibility:\nIf the deposition reaction (Equation 2) was in this case wholly irreversible, then no plateau would appear because no reactant would be\navailable. This is an unlikely cause because the relatively large quantities of stripped lithium suggest a high degree of process reversibility\nacross a wide range of fast charging rates. iv) Fast chemical intercalation: High cell temperature resulting from self-heating may accelerate\nCI beyond a threshold. In doing so, deposited Li that could otherwise be recovered via stripping instead chemically intercalates during\nthe potentiostatic charge phase, leaving only irreversibly-deposited\nLi and no stripping plateau. v) Accelerated side reactions: High cell\ntemperature could accelerate side reactions between the Li [0] and electrolyte, forming SEI constituents and reducing or eliminating the",

Lichemical increases as charge current density does because _t_ CV increases. Similarly, higher values of current density lead to\nincreased heat generation and higher temperatures that accelerate CI.\nSince _t_ CV and _T_ are positively correlated with both the charge rate and\nthe quantity Lichemical, the faster the charging, the greater the amount\nby which Equation 10 underestimates Liplated. This is especially problematic because, under some circumstances, accurate plating quantification is more useful following higher rate charging when plating is\nmost likely, than under lower rate charging.\nIt is dangerous to ignore the chemically intercalated amount because underestimation of plating could lead to continued cell operation in spite of dendrite formation and the possibility of a short circuit.\nHence, this work advocates for an update of existing plating quantification methods by accounting for Lichemical whenever a potentiostatic\ncharge phase is employed. A future work will attempt to quantify\nLichemical. We hypothesize that as Liplated exceeds its true maximum, the\ncalculated (reported) value will decrease because Lichemical increases\n(long CV phase durations).

Figure 12a\nillustrates a DV profile (purple) representing a stripping process occurring following 1 _._ 8 mA _._ cm [\u2212][2] charging.

Physically, this suggests\na lesser contribution from the Li [0] to the mixed NE potential, and a relatively greater contribution from LixC6.

The technique can therefore be employed under the conditions of EV fast charging when additional consideration is given. DV\nanalysis and electrode microscopy validated the hypothesis that an absence of lithium stripping plateaus is not indicative of an absence of\nlithium plating. Therefore, the belief that no stripping plateau represents healthy, plating-free cell operation was shown to be a converse\nerror. Traditionally, longer stripping plateaus have been considered to\nrepresent more dangerous scenarios with more lithium plating having\noccurred. However, the results highlight that the reverse may sometimes be true, since longer stripping plateaus represent good plating\nprocess reversibility. Dangerous processes such as lithium dendrite\nformation and earlier thermal runaway rely on the occurrence of irreversible plating. These dangerous processes are therefore inhibited\nwhen the plating process exhibits good reversibility, as indicated by\nthe presence of a long stripping plateau.\nThe relationship between fast charging rate and chemical intercalation was investigated. The results suggest that lithium plating quantification without consideration for lithium chemically intercalated\nduring CV phase charging causes underestimation of the plated quantity. The amount by which Liplated is underestimated increases at the\nhigher charging rates that render the plating both more likely and more\nextensive (dangerous). Moreover, the error involved in treating stripping quantification as plating quantification has been highlighted. The\ndependency of _Q_ stripped on the discharge rate was investigated and further work is required to better understand the underlying mechanisms.\nWhere lithium plating quantities are relatively small, _Q_ d _V_ d _Q_ [\u2212][1] inflections were shown to not exhibit minima, limiting the sensitivity of\nthe technique. _Q_ d _V_ d _Q_ [\u2212][1] stripping inflection end points were demonstrated to contain valuable information and to exhibit a statistically\nsignificant correlation with _Q_ stripped. _\ufffd_ e has therefore been suggested\nfor estimation of _Q_ stripped when _Q_ stripped is so low in magnitude that\n_Q_ d _V_ d _Q_ [\u2212][1] stripping inflections do not exhibit minima. As a result,\nthe application window of the technique has been widened to include\nlower levels of lithium plating.\nThe field of in-situ lithium plating identification and quantification by the voltage plateau method remains underdeveloped. Valuable\nfuture work includes i) quantification of Lichemical. Novel plating quantification techniques, such as that presented in Ref. 31, could enable\nexperimental quantification of Liplated during charging. Differencing\nwith respect to Liplated as calculated by the voltage plateau method\nwould enable Lichemical estimation. ii) If GoF was to be improved\nbetween the calculated and experimental full cell DV profiles, then\ndegradation mode quantification could be improved for cells MT1 and\nMT2, similar to that in Refs. 3, 34. The result could be compared with\nLLI quantities estimated in this work by the voltage plateau method,\nand the method\u2019s accuracy further studied.
