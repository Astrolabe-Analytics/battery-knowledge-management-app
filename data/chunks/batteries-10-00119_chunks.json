Introduction** Lithium-ion batteries are widely used in electric vehicles (EV). The lifespan of EV\nbatteries is limited and varies based on the selected chemistry, storage conditions, and use.\nThe literature suggests a capacity decrease of 20% to 30% for an EV at the end of its first\nlife. Batteries still retain 70% to 80% of their initial capacity [1,2]. Batteries from EV can\nbe reused in second-life applications for 70% to 40% of their cell nominal capacity. It is an\nopportunity to postpone recycling and reduce the environmental impact.\nMost of the aging studies on lithium-ion cell focus on their use in EV. However,\nlithium-ion cells can be impacted by various aging mechanisms, some of which are known\nto cause an acceleration in the loss of capacity after hundreds or thousands of cycles. The\nacceleration in capacity fade, also called aging-knee, may reduce the lifespan in secondlife applications and reduce the benefits of reuse of lithium-ion cells. All lithium-ion\ncells\u2014lithium iron phosphate (LFP), lithium manganese oxide (LMO), or lithium nickel\nmanganese cobalt oxides (NMC)\u2014may encounter an acceleration in capacity fade [3\u20139].\nThe acceleration in capacity fade apparition depends on several factors: cell chemistry,\ntemperature of use, current, and depth of discharge [9]. A review by Peter et al. discusses\nthis phenomenon and gives some postmortem analyses of cells undergoing this acceleration\nin capacity fade [9]. Those studies point out a possible acceleration in capacity fade that\ncould prevent a reuse in second-life applications due to a low capacity or a limited number\nof operating cycles. A review of non-invasive diagnosis techniques has been published by\nCarlos et al. to analyze lithium-ion cells using electric data [10]. A pic tracking technique is",

Graphite/LFP Cell Aging Experiment_ Experiments were conducted on three A123 18650 graphite/LFP cells with a nominal\ncapacity of 1.1 Ah. The cell was aged in a thermal chamber at 50 _[\u25e6]_ C, with a depth of\ndischarge (DoD) set to 100%. The cell was discharged following a current profile derived\nfrom the worldwide harmonized light vehicles test procedures (WLTP) until the cell voltage\nreached 2.5 V [18]. This WLTP cycle featured an average discharge rate of C/3, a maximum\ndischarge C-rate of 2.7C, and a maximum regenerative C-rate of 1.2C. This discharge cycle\naccounted for energy regeneration during vehicle braking. The data obtained regarding\nthe experimental evolution of the cell\u2019s state of health are presented in Figure 1. The cell\nstate of health reached 40~30% at the end of the experiment depending on the cell. The\ncharacterization was conducted after every 100 cycles to measure the cell capacity. **Figure 1.** Evolution of the cells\u2019 state of health during the experiment. All three cells experienced a linear decline in the state of health during the first 1500,\n2200 and 2300 transferred ampere-hours. All cells experienced acceleration in the slope\nafter these first stages. Subsequently, a faster cell capacity decrease is observed. The linear\ndecline in capacity can be attributed to LLI, while the acceleration in capacity fade can be\nrelated to LAM [19]. Indeed, a loss of capacity and active material at the negative electrode\n(LAMNE) can occur due to uniform or non-uniform aging phenomena.\nCells 1 and 2 are opened in a postmortem study in order to identify the causes of this\ncapacity loss after a long-term aging cycle. Those cells are opened and analyzed in the\nsame condition as the pristine cell for comparison. Then, the morphology of the electrode\nmaterials and their compositions are analyzed. Cells were dismantled in a glove box under\nan argon atmosphere. Samples were not washed in order to not damage the samples with\nbulky deposits and to compare all the samples in the same conditions. It was unclear if\nwashing would affect those fragile deposits as discussed by Waldmann et al. [13]. Coin\ncells were made in a glove box under argon atmosphere using LP30 electrolyte. Chemical\nelements were detected using EDXS and estimated using the PhiRhoZ estimation technique.",

Defects are mainly present at both ends of the\njellyroll at the core of the cell or near the casing in Figure 4: (i) the inner end of the coil (the\nend of the coil at the heart of the cell) is marked by the appearance of a large number of\ncracks and the active material detached from the collector; (ii) the edge at the outer end\n(end of the coil close to the cell casing) is marked by cracking, detached graphite from the\ncurrent collector, and golden/orange-colored deposits on the electrode surface in Figure 4b;\n(iii) a grey-colored deposit between the golden/orange deposit and the rest of the electrode\nexists and enlarged pictures of Figure 4b are shown in Figure 4c,d; (iv) the middle of the\njellyroll has less deposit formations and traces are repeatedly formed on the edge at the\nelectrical connector that provides the electrical link between the current collector and the\ntabs in Figure 4g,h.

The average surface area occupied is around 11%. Local\nformation of deposits on the negative electrode led to the loss of access to the graphite.\nOther rare surface defects exist within the electrode such as white deposits on the electrode\nsurface in Figure 4f or standalone grey deposits in Figure 4e. The white deposit surface\ncould suggest the presence of electrolyte salt. Darker areas, within the white deposits,\ncould suggest the presence of gas bubbles in the electrode prior to cell dismantling.

Further investigation should be done\nto properly link the presence of oxygen and nitrogen to SEI formation on graphite particles\nin a test without air contamination.\nCell 2\u2019s light gray area (cf. Figure 6b) shows the presence of spheres on the surface of\ngraphite particles between 0.5 and 1 \u00b5m. Using EDXS, the fuorine content rises around\n60% for a detection on a completely coated graphite particle. Both EDXS measurements\nfrom Figure 6a,b have the same amount of oxygen. The high presence of fluorine and the\nshape of the crystals observed on the surface correspond to the same deposit of lithium\nfluoride (LiF) detected by Anderson et al. [22].",

On the contrary, it is worth mentioning that the\nLFP positive electrode does not undergo specific aging leading to material degradation,\ndetachment from the electrode, or the appearance of surface defects. In this section, we aim\nto discuss our findings and compare those data with other authors\u2019 results and conclusions.\nThis discussion provides some possible reactions that could explain the apparition of LiF\nand bulky deposits on the electrodes. Those local deposits are correlated with the loss\nof active material at the negative electrode. We recall that the dark gray area (graphite\nelectrode) only lost 9% capacity on average, whereas a 30% capacity loss of the negative\nelectrode was detected in a previous study [11]. Bulky deposits were extremely fragile\nand impossible to characterize in coin cells. Moreover, they detach easily from the current\ncollector. We believe those areas are inoperable and would explain the greater capacity loss\ndetected in the full-cell configuration.\nCommercial lithium-ion cells generally contain lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF6)\nsalt dissolved in a cyclic ethylene carbonate (EC) with linear dimethyl carbonate (DMC)\nand/or diethyl carbonate (DEC) solvents as the electrolyte. Hou et al. recall that a cascade\nof reduction reactions occur during the first cycle, and that the initially formed SEI contains\ninorganic species and organic species [23]. Li2CO3 and LiF are inorganic species commonly\nreported as formed in the primary SEI layer with other organic species such as lithium\nethylene decarbonates (LEDC, (CH2OCO2Li)2) or lithium alkyl carbonates (ROCO2Li) [24].\nSEI formation and further reactions leading to cell aging depend on the negative electrode\ncomponents (material, chemistry, structure), electrolyte components, and concentrations\nincluding salts, additives, impurities, or reaction-side products [23]. The formation of LiF\ncan come from various sources: (i) degradation of the electrolyte salt LiPF6 thank to the\nreaction (1), (ii) reactions (3) and (4) with the first layers of Li2CO3 SEI, or (iii) reaction (2)\nto water. The first two paths of LiF formation can occur in commercial lithium-ion cells.\nThe last condition requires a contamination with H2O during cell manufacturing. The\nreaction (2) with water contamination is discussed in the literature [23]. LiPF6 is known\nto be unstable with lithium carbonate in DMC [24]. The thermal decomposition of LiPF6\nfollows Equation (1) and exhibits a potential-dependent kinetics [25]. This decomposition\ncan occur in high temperature conditions or at high overpotential or at low potentials at\nthe pristine edge plane [23,25]. According to Andersson et al., the formation of LiF on the\ncarbon electrode increases the interfacial resistance because of a poor conductivity of this\ndeposit [22]. In the opinion of Anderson et al., the transformation of Li2CO3 to LiF does not\naccount for the very large increase in LiF in their study. Salt decomposition reactions may be\nthe main reason of LiF formation. Its formation could be due to LiPF6 degradation catalyzed\nby graphite exposure (e.g., SEI and/or graphite cracking) [22]. Henschel et al. studied\nthe aging of lithium-ion cells after use in electric vehicles [26]. The conducting salt LiPF6\ndegrades in several reactions leading to the formation of several products: acidic and nonacidic oregano(fluoro)phosphates. Henschel et al. determined that LiPF6 salt undergoes\na significant decomposition in electric vehicles, resulting in lower concentration than the\ninitial electrolyte salt [26]. Numerous acidic and non-acidic organo(fluoro) phosphates, as\nwell as POF3 were identified in many samples, which supported the authors\u2019 findings:",

These reactions of decomposition of\nthe electrolyte may lead to a cell dry out. Fang et al. shows that the battery lifespan is\ninfluenced by the amount of electrolytes [29]. Authors propose that the transition from\nlinear to nonlinear aging could be induced by a continuous loss of electrolytes. This\nassumption may explain the bulky deposits observed in our postmortem study on the\nelectrode. Local loss of electrolytes leading to a dry out can isolate graphite particles,\nleading to a loss of active material. Despite this, other areas of the negative electrode\nremained able to retain 90% of the initial capacity. A study should be carried out to explain\nthe correlation between the heavy deposits, probably due to high reactivity with electrolyte,\nwhich might lead to cell dry out, and the high brittleness of graphite and its detachment\nfrom the current collector in the same area.\nAs a result, the aging of graphite/LFP cells to low states of health, representative\nof a use in second-life applications, has various stages of aging resulting from different\nelectrochemical processes. A representation of those aging processes is given as successive\naging phenomena in Figure 10. This figure aims to provide a general view of the formation\nof inhomogeneous aging on the negative electrode. However, it does not aim to detail the\ncomposition of the bulky deposits. First, the primary layer of SEI appears after the cell\nmanufacturing in Figure 10a. During the use in first-life applications, the SEI thickens on\nthe graphite particles as represented by a thicker line on graphite particles in Figure 10b.\nThe use of lithium-ion cells involves lithiation and delithiation operations of the graphite\nparticles. Subsequently, cracks can appear through the SEI due to bad mechanical strength\nof Li2CO3, resulting in possible contact of the electrolyte and LiPF6 with graphite particles\nin Figure 10c. In the case of deep discharge, the graphite can experience a change in particle\nvolume of up to 10% [30]. The crack initiates a new reaction forming additional SEIs and\nother reactions resulting in LiF and gas emissions in Figure 10d. These gas emissions cause\na local increase in pressure and possible deformations. In large quantities, a gas bubble\ncan form and impede the passage of lithium ions. The gases formed trigger new reactions,\nresulting in the consumption of cyclable lithium and new deposits on the electrodes. LiF is\ninsulating and prevents lithium ions from transferring to the electrode. Lithium may stay\non the electrode in contact with electrolytes leading to additional reactions and deposits in\nFigure 10e. Inorganic compounds also participate in the formation of this new deposit. The\nsequence of these phenomena leads to a significant consumption of cyclable lithium and\nthe deposition of a highly resistive or even insulating layer on the negative electrode in\nFigure 10f.",

      "text": "**4. Conclusions** Aging tests and postmortem analyses show that graphite/LFP lithium-ion cells hold\nup very well over time. Namely, no safety problems arose during the tests, and no dendritic\nformation was observed. The postmortem study showed that the LFP electrode does not\nage over time and over a very large number of charge/discharge cycles. No electrical or\nmechanical changes were observed. Indeed, mechanical properties were maintained after\nseveral thousand cycles.\nThe negative electrode, on the other hand, shows a high degree of degradation after\nthousands of cycles. In fact, some local areas were severely degraded by the apparition of\nLiF formation, thick SEI deposition, graphite cracking, and exfoliation. This paper does\nnot investigate the reason for fragile graphite in aged cells contrary to the pristine cell. The\nlower mechanical stability during cell opening could be a sign of structural changes inside\nthe graphite electrode such as loss of mechanical stability due to poorer binder mechanical\nstrength. Poorer mechanical stability and loss of contact with the current collector could\nbe another reason for the loss of active material at the negative electrode. Bulky deposits\non the electrode were detected; however, they were mainly composed of oxygen and were\nattributed to electrolyte decompositions. The bulky deposit leads to unusable electrode\nsections in the cell. Inhomogeneous aging of graphite electrodes leads to localized loss of\nactive material and overconsumption of lithium. The loss of active material at the negative\nelectrode can be a sign of acceleration in capacity loss due to increase in lithium reaction\nand loss of lithium inventory (LLI).\nLocal defects lead to graphite isolation, blocked lithium onto the surface, increased\nparasitic reactions with the electrolyte, increased deposits onto the surface, and changes in\nits morphology. The impossibility to use a fraction of the electrode highlights the direct\nimpact of loss of active material at the negative electrode (LAMNE) in commercial cells and\nthe overall cell capacity. The localized loss of lithium due to inhomogeneous aging besides\nstandard SEI formation leads to an increase in capacity fade.\nThis postmortem study confirms the apparition of inhomogeneous aging on the\nnegative electrode, while the positive electrode operates in the same manner as the pristine\nelectrode. As a result, the lithiation and delithiation no longer takes place over the entire\nsurface of the electrode, leading to lithium being trapped in those areas and resulting\nin a supplementary capacity fade. Thus, the loss of capacity in the graphite/LFP cell is\ndue to SEI formation and loss of active material at the negative electrode, leading to a\nsupplementary capacity fade in long-term aging. Therefore, it is necessary to diagnose\nthe negative electrode\u2019s state of health in order to provide an accurate prognosis of the\nremaining useful life of batteries in second-life applications.",
