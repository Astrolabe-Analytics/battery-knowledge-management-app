      "text": "Energy storage systems with Li-ion batteries are increasingly deployed to maintain a robust and resilient grid and facilitate the\nintegration of renewable energy resources. However, appropriate selection of cells for different applications is difficult due to\nlimited public data comparing the most commonly used off-the-shelf Li-ion chemistries under the same operating conditions. This\narticle details a multi-year cycling study of commercial LiFePO4 (LFP), LiNixCoyAl1\u2212x\u2212yO2 (NCA), and LiNixMnyCo1\u2212x\u2212yO2\n(NMC) cells, varying the discharge rate, depth of discharge (DOD), and environment temperature. The capacity and discharge\nenergy retention, as well as the round-trip efficiency, were compared. Even when operated within manufacturer specifications, the\nrange of cycling conditions had a profound effect on cell degradation, with time to reach 80% capacity varying by thousands of\nhours and cycle counts among cells of each chemistry. The degradation of cells in this study was compared to that of similar cells in\nprevious studies to identify universal trends and to provide a standard deviation for performance. All cycling files have been made\npublicly available at batteryarchive.org, a recently developed repository for visualization and comparison of battery data, to\nfacilitate future experimental and modeling efforts.\n\u00a9 2020 The Author(s).

[1][\u2013][3] For applications in the electric grid,\nESS are expected to last for a decade or even longer. A typical MWh\nsystem may contain as many as 100,000 cells assembled into packs. To\nensure system safety and reliability, cells must be selected based on\napplication specific requirements and performance characteristics. Yet\nthere are few comparisons of popular commercial cells under similar\noperating conditions. In this work, we detail the cycling performance of\ncommercial LFP (LiFePO4), NCA (LiNixCoyAl1\u2212x\u2212yO2), and NMC\n(LiNixMnyCo1\u2212x\u2212yO2) cells with an 18650 form factor, in the broadest\nsuch comparison to be reported in a peer-reviewed publication.\nBattery specification sheets from manufacturers primarily focus\non safety metrics, such as current, voltage, and temperature bounds,\nwith limited information on performance metrics. Many publications\nin the open literature have examined the long-term performance and\naging of commercial Li-ion cells in order to fill this gap. There are\nnotable recent studies for each of the chemistries\u2014LFP, [4][\u2013][11] NCA, [6][,][10][,][12][\u2013][14] and NMC, [6][,][15][\u2013][17] \u2014under calendar, constant current\nsquare wave cycle, and grid duty cycle aging. However, each of\nthese studies typically focuses on a single chemistry under a limited\nsubset of conditions to understand the influence of a particular\nvariable, such as temperature, or the emergence of a particular\ndegradation phenomena, such as Li plating.\nThe short-term cycling performance [18] and calorimetry [19] for the\ncells selected for the present study has been reported previously, and\nthis work is part of a broader effort at Sandia National Laboratories\nto characterize the safety and reliability of commercial Li-ion cells.",

Cycling was carried out under constant current\nsquare wave duty cycles rather than grid duty cycles to better\nunderstand the contribution of specific and simple cycling conditions\nto the degradation process. Various metrics for comparing cell\ndegradation were investigated, including equivalent full cycle count,\ndischarge energy, and round-trip efficiency. The degradation of the\ncells in this study was compared to that of similar cells in previous\nstudies to provide a standard deviation for performance and facilitate\na more data-informed adoption of these batteries.

The holders were connected to the Arbin with 18 gauge\nwire and the cable lengths kept below eight feet to minimize voltage\ndrop. During cycling, the cells were placed in SPX Tenney Model\nT10C-1.5 environmental chambers, which can be controlled between\n\u221273 \u00b0C and 200 \u00b0C. A K- or T-type thermocouple was attached to\nthe skin of each cell under test with Kapton tape to monitor the cell\nskin temperature. Cycle aging protocol.\u2014At the start of the study, the as-received\ncells were placed in thermal chambers for a day to equilibrate to the\ndesired cycling temperatures. Then, the cells were discharged. Each\nround of cycling consisted of a capacity check, some number of\ncycles at the designated conditions for that cell, and another capacity\ncheck at the end (Scheme 1). The capacity check consisted of three\ncharge/discharge cycles from 0%\u2013100% SOC at 0.5C (a rate of 1C\ncorresponds to the current that will discharge the full capacity of a\nbattery in one hour). 100% SOC is defined as the capacity obtained\nat a 0.5C constant current charge with a current taper to 0.05 A to the\nmaximum manufacturer-specified charging voltage. The same capacity check protocol was employed for all cells in the study. Scheme 1. Structure of cycle aging study. A round of cycling for each cell varied from 125 to 1000 cycles,\ndepending on the rate of degradation at the specific test conditions.\nThe cycle count for a round was halved if a cell experienced over 5%\ncapacity loss in the previous round. These adjustments were\nintended to offer enough granulation in the capacity decline curve\nto enable observation of any changes in mechanism, while still\nmaintaining a reasonable check-up frequency during a nearly threeyear study. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was\ncompleted at intervals of approximately 3% capacity loss, and these\nresults will be expanded upon in a future publication. For the\npurpose of this publication, the study was considered complete once\na cell reached 80% of its initial capacity.\nSeveral abort guidelines were built into the cycling program to\navoid potentially abusive conditions for the cells.

To ensure repeatability, each test was performed with\nat least two cells.\nThe nominal capacities of the cells were used as references for\ncalculating C-rates. All cells were charged at a rate of 0.5C, per\nmanufacturer guidance.

Round-trip efficiency, another important metric for technoeconomic evaluation of LiBs, is shown in Fig. 2c. [22] The RTE for a cycle\nwas calculated by dividing the discharge energy by the charge\nenergy. A single RTE is often assumed for economic evaluations;\nhowever, RTE depends substantially on the cycling conditions,\nincluding the charge/discharge rate, temperature, SOC, and rest time.\nThe LFP cells show higher RTEs than NCA and NMC cells at all\nconditions, though the differences are minimized at lower discharge\nrates. The NCA cells exhibited particular sensitivity to higher\ndischarge rates, with RTEs dropping 5%\u201310% for an increase in\ndischarge rate from 1C to 2C at all temperatures. The decrease in\nRTE across all cycling conditions as the cells reach 80% capacity is\nattributed to the increase in cell resistance as the SEI layer grows. Figure 1.

The spread in the data for each of the chemistries\nindicates that even within the manufacturer-specified operating\nbounds there is significant dependence on the specific cycling\nconditions. Irrespective of the testing conditions, all cells exhibited\nprimarily linear degradation behavior, with slightly more rapid fade\nat the beginning and end of cycling. This behavior is in agreement\nwith previous models of lithium-ion battery degradation which\npropose three phases of capacity fade [20][,][21] :\nPhase 1: Sudden drop in capacity as Li is consumed during SEI\nformation\nPhase 2: Linear degradation, generally associated with loss of Li\ninventory in side reactions\nPhase 3: Rapid capacity fade as the cell fails, often attributed to\nan impedance increase\nFigure 2a indicates the EFC for each cell to reach 80% capacity\nunder the given cycling conditions. Though cells may be used\nbeyond 80% capacity in grid applications, this value is a useful\nbenchmark as it is often the reference used by manufacturers in\nspecification sheets to indicate end of life. For LFP cells that have\nnot yet reached 80% capacity, the lifetime was extrapolated based on\nthe present (linear) degradation rate. Among the three chemistries,\nthere is no universal dependence on temperature, DOD, or discharge\nrate. A more systematic analysis of variable dependence is presented\nbelow.\nThough EFC is typically the metric by which batteries are\ncompared, cumulative discharge energy may offer more value for\nfield implementation. The EFC may mask degradation differences\narising in batteries with different capacity and voltage ranges.\nFigure 2b indicates the cumulative discharge energy for a cell under\neach set of cycling conditions at 80% capacity retention. This value\nwas calculated by summing the energy from each individual\ndischarge of the cell. The performance differences between the\nthree chemistries were minimized once the analysis factored in the\nlower capacity and voltage of the LFP cells (see Table I).",

The capacity fade rate increased with\nincreasing temperature for LFP cells but decreased for NMC cells.\nThe NCA cells did not exhibit a strong temperature dependence in\nthe examined range. Different temperature dependences suggest\ndifferent dominant degradation mechanisms. Though not observed in\nthis study, the transition between degradation mechanisms within a\nsingle cell was previously documented by Waldmann et al. [23] An\nArrhenius plot from their work on 18650 NMC/LMO-graphite cells\nis reproduced in Fig. 4. Below 25 \u00b0C, the dominant aging mechanism\nwas Li plating, confirmed by observation of metallic Li. Deposition\nof Li onto the graphite anode can occur in parallel to intercalation\nwhen the anode potential drops below 0 V vs Li/Li [+] (promoted by\nfactors such as increasing SOC, increasing charge rate, and lower\ntemperature). [24] Above 25 \u00b0C, the dominant mechanism was SEI\n(solid-electrolyte interphase) growth, confirmed by post-mortem\ncharacterization of SEI thickness on the anodes and correlated to\nresistance increases in the whole cells. The SEI is formed from the\ndecomposition products of electrolyte solvent and Li salt, a reaction\naccelerated by increasing temperature. [25] Previous studies of temperature dependence may not have observed the transition between\nthe two degradation mechanisms in the same cell because they did\nnot consider a sufficiently broad temperature range.\nThe capacity fade data for NMC and LFP cells from the present\nstudy was fit in the linear region (after the initial period of rapid\ncapacity fade) to obtain aging rates as a function of temperature.\nComparison to the previously reported NMC-LMO data indicates\nthat the tipping point between different mechanisms (the point of\nminimal degradation in Fig. 4) varies substantially with the\nchemistry (Table III). For example, previous reports on cycle aging\nof LFP cells indicate a tipping point at temperatures of 5 \u00b0C\u201310 \u00b0C,\nwith degradation rates increasing both above and below this\ntemperature. [26] Studies of LFP cells that considered temperatures\nonly above 20 \u00b0C observed the capacity fade increase with\nincreasing temperature (consistent with the present work). [27][\u2013][29]",

Many models assume optimal performance at\n25 \u00b0C with higher temperatures only accelerating SEI formation. It\nshould be noted that the above analysis only applies to cycle aging\nstudies. For calendar aging studies across LFP, [6][,][9] NCA, [6] and\nNMC [6][,][15] cells, capacity fade consistently decreased with decreasing (1) transition between graphite stages (at specific voltages) with\ndiffering lattice parameters enhancing cracking and SEI\nformation, [15] or\n(2) slow Li diffusion at particular voltages leading to Li build-up\nand graphite particle fracturing [36] The results of the present study cannot be used to address this\ndiscrepancy as the mid-point of the depth of discharge window was\nnot varied.\nCompared to LFP [7][,][33][,][34] cells, the NCA [35][\u2013][37] and NMC [15][,][17][,][38][,][39] cells experienced a more dramatic transition in capacity fade from\npartial to complete DOD and this result is consistent with previous\nstudies. This transition could be attributed to the metal oxide\ncathodes\u2019 higher operating voltages (100% SOC corresponds to\n4.2 V for NCA and NMC vs 3.6 V for LFP), which could promote\nelectrolyte oxidation.

Irrespective of chemistry, in calendar aging studies,\ncapacity fade consistently increased with SOC, as lower anode\npotentials enhance electrolyte reduction and Li incorporation into the\ngrowing SEI. As in cycle aging studies, NCA and NMC cells\nexhibited particularly rapid capacity fade at 100% SOC. [6] Discharge rate dependence.\u2014Higher discharge rates are expected to accelerate capacity fade due to increased stress on the\nelectrodes from rapid volume change. [32][,][40][,][41] In Figs. 3g\u20133h, the\ndischarge rate dependence for NMC and LFP cells appears low.\nHowever, for NCA cells, capacity fade decreased with increasing\ndischarge rate (Fig. 3i).

[42] It is possible that the higher discharge rate may increase\ncell self-heating (Table SII), leading to improved performance; but,\nthe NCA cells did not exhibit a particularly strong temperature\ndependence. It is also possible that the shorter period of cycling needed to complete discharge (1 h for 1C vs 0.5 h for 2C) can\nminimize the degree of calendar aging over the course of hundreds\nof cycles.

The p values from ANOVA\n(Table SIII) are below the chosen significance level of 0.05.\nAdditionally, there was a significant interaction between cell\nchemistry and SOC range, and cell chemistry and temperature.\nResidual plots (Fig. S3) from this model fit show that the assumptions of randomness, constant variance, and normally distributed\nresiduals are all reasonable.

Figure 6 shows a subset of these comparisons and\nthe rest are given in Fig. S4. Degradation data for cells from the\nsame manufacturer appears consistent across publications, even\nthose separated by several years (Figs. 6b, 6c). However, for cells\nfrom different manufacturers sometimes the degradation rate is the\nsame (Fig. 6e) and sometimes it is not (over three times difference in\ncycle count to 80% capacity in Fig. 6f). These differences suggest\nthat lifetime prognostics based on a particular cell from a particular\nmanufacturer cannot be broadly extrapolated, even to other cells\nwith the same standard form factor, chemistry, and capacity. Subtle\nvariations in materials, such as electrolyte composition, can substantially impact battery lifetime (though that level of detail\nwould not be available on a basic battery specification sheet).\nEmpirical battery degradation models would benefit from the\nincorporation of larger data sets and reporting values with a standard\ndeviation to give users a better sense of the true lifetime of these\ncells.

LFP\ncells generally had higher RTEs at all conditions and for all cells,\nRTE consistently decreased with increasing discharge rate.\n(4) Based on the current work and a review of previous commercial\ncell studies, trends in temperature, depth of discharge, and\ndischarge rate dependence are chemistry specific.
