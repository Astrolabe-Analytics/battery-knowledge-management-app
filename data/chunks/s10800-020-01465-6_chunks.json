Post-mortem analysis focuses on the structure of the\nelectrodes using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and the chemical composition\nchanges using energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The results\nshow that ageing at lower DOD results in higher capacity fading compared to higher DOD cycling. The anode surface aged at\n55 \u00b0C forms a dense cover on the graphite flakes, while at the anode surface aged at \u2212 20 \u00b0C lithium plating and LiF crystals\nare observed. As expected, Fe dissolution from the cathode and deposition on the anode are observed for the ageing performed\nat 55 \u00b0C, while Fe dissolution and deposition are not observed at \u2212 20 \u00b0C. Using atomic force microscopy (AFM), the surface\nconductivity is examined, which shows only minor degradation for the cathodes aged at \u2212 20 \u00b0C. The cathodes aged at 55 \u00b0C\nexhibit micrometer size agglomerates of nanometer particles on the cathode surface. The results indicate that cycling at\nhigher SOC ranges is more detrimental and low temperature cycling mainly affects the anode by the formation of plated Li. **Graphic abstract** **Keywords** Iron dissolution \u00b7 Vanadium dissolution \u00b7 Li-ion \u00b7 Li-plating \u00b7 LiF crystals \u00b7 Degradation **Electronic supplementary material** The online version of this\n[article (https\u200b://doi.org/10.1007/s1080\u200b0-020-01465\u200b-6) contains](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10800-020-01465-6)\nsupplementary material, which is available to authorized users.

The focus is especially on lithium ion batteries, due to their relatively high energy density, low selfdischarge, falling costs and scalability in battery packs.\nHowever, even after roughly 30 years of development,\nmany drawbacks still exist which limit the further utilisation and competitiveness. \u00adLiFePO4 (LFP) is a promising\ncell chemistry with potential to overcome all current drawbacks. It offers a relatively high working potential (3.5 V\nvs. Li/Li [+] ) and specific capacity of roughly 170 mAh \u00adg [\u22121] .\nThe use of iron and phosphorus makes it a sustainable\nchoice, since the materials are abundant and less toxic\ncompared to Co, Ni and Mn [1]. It was firstly introduced\nby Padhi et al. [2, 3] and continuously improved since\nthen. The main drawbacks of LFP are the low electronic\nand ionic conductivity. Additionally, for the ionic conductivity, the diffusion is highly anisotropic, due to the olivine structure of the material with 1D transport. Electronic\n\u00ad(10 [\u20137] to \u00ad10 [\u20139] S \u00adcm [\u22121] ) and ionic conductivity \u00ad(10 [\u201311] to \u00ad10 [\u201320]\n\u00adm [2] s [\u22121] ) values in the literature span over several magnitudes and are still under debate [4]. Moreover, the reaction\nmechanism is assumed to follow either a \u2018core\u2013shell\u2019 or\n\u2018domino\u2019 mechanism [2, 4, 5]. These difficulties show that\nthe material is still not entirely understood and further\nanalysis and research is necessary to clarify the underlying mechanisms leading to the different observations and\nparameter values. Regarding the degradation mechanisms,\nthe scientific community is in overall agreement, that Fe\ndissolution and Li consumption during ageing are mainly\nresponsible for the capacity fading [6\u201310]. The effect of\nthe cathode surface layer on the capacity fading is not clear\nyet and is assumed to be negligible [11, 12] or likewise\naffecting the capacity fading and impedance increase [7,\n9, 13]. Post-mortem analysis techniques are useful tools\nto gain further insight into the degradation mechanisms\nand their dependencies on the ageing parameters like temperature, current and cycling range of the state-of-charge\n(SOC) (or depth-of-discharge, DOD). Scanning electron\nmicroscopy (SEM) in combination with energy dispersive\nX-ray spectroscopy (EDX) is widely used to analyse material structure and element distributions of electrodes. Lewerenz et al. used SEM and EDX to analyse the covering\nlayer formed on the anode surface [14]. They observed\na compact and dense surface layer containing Li, Fe and\nelectrolyte decomposition products. The compact layer can\ndeactivate parts of the electrodes and contribute to the\ncapacity fading and increase of internal resistance [14].\nIn combination with focused ion beam cutting techniques\n(FIB), it can be used to generate a 3D model of the electrodes and further analyse the ageing. Scipioni et al. use\nFIB-SEM to generate 3D models of aged LFP cathodes\nand observe a decrease of the particle size distribution\nand agglomeration of carbon black particles [15]. Wang\net al. used SEM and EDX to track the corrosion of LFP",

Steinhauer et al. used in-situ AFM to follow the\nSEI evolution during the first cycle on crystalline carbon\nand observed dynamic surface structures with a potential\ndependent speed of growth [21]. Hiesgen et al. used AFM\nto analyse the morphology of sulphur cathodes depending on the binder material and observed a decrease of the\nelectronic surface conductivity after ageing, which correlated with the capacity decay [22]. Wu et al. analysed\naged \u00adLiCoO2 cathode surfaces and observed an increase\nin grain size and surface roughness and a decrease of the\nsurface potential and material stiffness. They attributed\nthese changes to the loss of lithium, the fracturing and\nagglomeration of particles and the generation of a surface\nlayer from electrolyte decomposition products [23].\nSeveral studies performed post-mortem analyses of commercial \u00adLiFePO4 cells using a variety of ageing parameters,\nsuch as different temperatures and current loads and analysed the electrodes afterwards [9, 10, 13, 14, 24, 25]. These\nstudies show, that cycling at elevate temperatures promotes\nthe dissolution of Fe from the cathode and the capacity fading is mainly caused by loss of lithium inventory due to the\ngeneration of surface layers and loss of active material.\nThe results presented here add additional insight into\nthe degradation of commercial \u00adLiFePO4 cells. In particular,\nadditional influences of the DOD is shown for Fe dissolution\nas a known degradation mechanisms and the importance\nof vanadium dissolution is shown for the first time. Furthermore, unknown degradation mechanisms with respect\nto LiF deposition, decrease in surface conductivity and the\noccurrence of higher amount of oxygenated species for the\nageing at \u2212 20 \u00b0C compared to 55 \u00b0C are reported.",

The cells are cycled using the last part of\nthe \u201cworldwide harmonised light vehicles test procedure\u201d\n(WLTP) ageing profile (AP1). Additionally, to increase and\nspeed up the ageing, the current was doubled, to generate a\nsecond test protocol (AP2). The cycling used two different\nDOD: 50% DOD (SOC 100\u201450%) and 100% DOD (SOC\n100\u20140%). For each ageing group, a set of three cells was\nused. The cells were cycled using AP1 or AP2 until they\nreached the specified discharge capacity, based on the DOD.\nAfterwards, they were charged using 1C until 100% SOC\nand the dynamic current profile restarted. The cycling was\nconducted at 55 \u00b0C and \u2212 20 \u00b0C. After 2000 Ah total discharge capacity passed through the cells during the ageing\nprocess, the protocol was stopped and post-mortem analysis\nwas conducted.\nThe temperatures are chosen, firstly, to accelerate the\naging of the cells and secondly, since these temperatures\nrepresent the minimum and maximum of the temperature\noperation range of the manufacturers data sheet for these\ncells. In addition, these temperatures are only slightly lower\nfor the minimum temperature (\u2212 15 \u00b0C) and in comparable\nrange for the maximum temperature (+ 35 \u00b0C), as they are\nobserved as ambient temperatures for example in the USA [27]. The authors are aware of the thermal control system\ninside the modern automobiles, which regulates the temperature of the battery module during operation. However, during long resting times, the thermal control system is inactive\nand at least at the beginning of the automotive operation, the\nbattery module is exposed to non-optimized temperatures. **2.2 \u0007Sample preparation** After ageing, the cells were discharged to 0% SOC using 1C\n(regarding nominal capacity), transferred into an argon filled\nglovebox (MBraun, Germany) and disassembled. Samples\nwere cut out of the electrode sheets from around the first\ncurrent tab and from the electrode side facing the inside of\nthe cell. Afterwards, the samples were rinsed using dimethyl\ncarbonate (DMC, Sigma Aldrich, Alfa Aesar) and stored\ninside a glovebox. **2.3 \u0007SEM, AFM and XPS analysis**",

The\ncovering of the graphite flakes shows similar features as for\nthe fresh anode (Fig. 2f). However, similar structures and\nprecipitation on the anode surfaces aged at \u2212 20 \u00b0C, similar\nto the anodes aged at 55 \u00b0C, indicate electrolyte deposition\non the anode surface, but in a smaller extend (see Fig. 2g,\nillustration 2 h and Figure S1d and e). For SEM images\nwith lower magnification see Figure S1. Additionally, small\ncrystal-like structures of up to 500 nm developed, which\ncould indicate LiF, since LiF crystals have been observed\nbefore on aged anodes [31, 32].

The formation of plated Li\nis independent from the cycling profile, since it is found on\nanodes aged with 50% DOD with AP1 and 100% DOD with\nAP2 (Fig. 3). Li plating contributes to LLI, if Li is irreversibly plated. Moreover, the irreversibly plated Li can deactivate anode and cathode material, since covered surfaces on\nthe anode and opposite to that on the cathode are no longer\nelectrochemically active. Since the cells are disassembled\nin discharged state, the plated Li was not stripped off the\nanode surface during the discharge process.

One cycle for the 50% DOD cells represents 1.25 Ah\n\u00adcycle [\u22121], leading to roughly 1600 cycles until EOL, while for\nthe 100% DOD cells (2.5 Ah \u00adcycle [\u22121] ) only about 800 cycles\nare performed until EOL is reached. The higher amount of\npotential cycles for the 50% DOD cycling leads to a thicker\nSEI, which consumed more Li during the ageing. The\nanodes aged at \u2212 20 \u00b0C exhibit likewise an increase of P and\nO on the surfaces in a similar extent, even though a less pronounced SEI is observed in the SEM and AFM images. This\nis due to the plated Li, which reacts with the electrolyte to\nform decomposition products on the anodes aged at \u2212 20 \u00b0C,\neven when the surface of the graphite flakes is not covered\nentirely, as it is the case for the graphite flakes aged at 55 \u00b0C.\nSimilar trends for the oxygen content as already found\nfor phosphorus are observed on the anodes aged at 55 \u00b0C.\nThe mass of oxygen increased due to ageing by a factor\nof 4\u20136. The underlying origin is the same as for phosphorus. However, at \u2212 20 \u00b0C, the anode surfaces show a different behaviour. The cells aged at 100% DOD show a higher\noxygen content compared to the cells aged with 50% DOD.\nThis observation could be based on the existence of plated\nLi, which reacts with oxygen from the electrolyte or during\nthe transfer of the sample from the glovebox into the SEM\nobservation chamber. Petzl and Danzer [39] assume that\nthe Li plated at lower SOC (100% DOD cycling) is thicker\nand more stable compared to high SOC plating (50% DOD\ncycling).\nThe observed Fe dissolution exhibits the assumed temperature dependency. The anode surfaces aged at 55 \u00b0C show\nclearly the presence of Fe, while the anodes aged at \u2212 20 \u00b0C\ndo not show any significant amount. The Fe dissolution does\nnot show any clear dependency on the DOD. This clearly\nshows that high temperatures promote the Fe dissolution,\nwhile it is suppressed at low temperatures. Lastly, vanadium\nis observed on the anode surfaces. Due to the low electronic\nand ionic conductivity of LFP, it is doped with multivalent\ncations (like \u00adV [3+] ) to improve the conductivity [40]. All\ntransition metals commonly used in Li ion batteries are dissolved from the cathode into the electrolyte upon ageing [41,\n42]. As will be shown later, the mass content of V decreased\nin the cathodes after ageing, indicating dissolution of V from\nthe cathode and precipitation on the anode surface. The V\ncontent is generally higher at the anodes cycled at 55 \u00b0C. A\nnotable exception is the anode aged at 100% DOD with AP2\nat \u2212 20 \u00b0C, which showed a distinct higher amount as compared to the other cells. The origin of this observation is not\nentirely clear yet, but might indicate inhomogeneous deposition of V. The transition metals V and Fe act as catalysts at\nthe anode surface for the formation and subsequent growth\nof the SEI [6, 43]. The deposition of transition metals is\nin addition hindering the Li intercalation into the graphite",

It was observed, that the cells aged at 55 \u00b0C exhibit\na surface layer related increase of resistance between 12 and\n27%. The formation of surface layers consumes Li, which is\nafterwards lost for subsequent cycling, and deactivates anode\nmaterial by blocking the intercalation and de-intercalation\nprocess.\nFigure 6 shows the XPS spectra of anodes aged\nat \u2212 20 \u00b0C \u00ad(1 [st] and \u00ad2 [nd] row each) and 55 \u00b0C (3rd and 4th\nrow each) using 50% DOD with AP1 (2nd and 4th row)\nand AP2 (1st and 3rd row) in comparison to the fresh\nanode (5th row see also Table 1 for peak assignment).\nThe bulk spectra refer to the surface laid open after ion\netching for a total time of 2660 s, while the surface spectra\nwere recorded before. In the C1s surface spectra, the fresh\nanode shows four peaks around 284, 287, 288 and 292 eV.\nThe peak around 284 eV is assigned to C\u2013C and C\u2013H species. After ageing at 55 \u00b0C, the peak is no longer observed,\nwhile at \u2212 20 \u00b0C these species are still found. The vanishing of the peak around 284 eV for the anodes aged at 55 \u00b0C\nindicates a thick and homogeneous surface layer covering\nthe entire anode surface. Since the peak is still observed\nin the anodes aged at \u2212 20 \u00b0C, the surface layer is only\npartially covering the anode, as it was already observed in\nthe AFM measurements (Fig. 4). The peaks at 287 eV and\n288 eV are assigned to C\u2013O and C=O bonds, respectively.\nThe peak at 292 eV is assigned to decomposition products of the carbonate-based electrolyte. Interestingly, the\ncarbonate-based peak is not observed in the aged samples,\nneither in the surface layer nor in the bulk. After ion etching for 2660 s, the bulk material of all anodes exhibits only\nthe two peaks of the C\u2013C/C\u2013H and the C\u2013O species. Two\npeaks around 685 eV and 689 eV dominate the F1s surface spectra. They are attributed to \u00adLixPOyFz and \u00adLixPFz,\nrespectively, which are decomposition products of \u00adLiPF6.\nHowever, PVDF (polyvinylidene difluoride) as an assumed\nbinder material in the electrodes can influence the peak\naround 689 eV, due to the C\u2013F bond. \u00adLixPOyFz is additionally observed in the P2p surface spectra of all anodes\nat 136 eV. The anode aged at \u2212 20 \u00b0C with AP1 exhibits\na higher relative intensity for the \u00adLixPFz peak in the F1s\nspectrum compared to the other anodes. The P2p surface\nspectra points likewise to a higher \u00adLixPFz concentration\non the anodes aged at \u2212 20 \u00b0C compared to 55 \u00b0C, since\nthe peaks around 138 eV (assigned to \u00adLixPFz) are only\nobserved in the low temperature ageing. An additional\npeak appears around 685 eV for the anodes aged at \u2212 20 \u00b0C\nin the F1s bulk spectra, which is assigned to LiF. The attribution of LiF crystals to the observed features in the AFM\nimages for the anodes aged at \u2212 20 \u00b0C is therefore verified\nby the presence of this peak (only detected for the anodes\naged at \u2212 20 \u00b0C).

After the ageing at 55 \u00b0C, the cathode surfaces are covered by electrically non-conductive agglomerates having a\ndiameter of roughly 0.5 to 1 \u00b5m. The surface coverage is\nconsistently higher for the 100% DOD profile aged with AP1\nor AP2 (Fig. 7e, f and i, j) compared to the 50% DOD profile\n(Fig. 7c, d and g, h). The agglomerates consist of smaller\nparticles of roughly 15\u2013100 nm in diameter, which show a\nlower adhesion compared to the agglomerate-free cathode\nsurface (see Figure S4 for higher magnification). The adhesion is governed by electrostatic interactions between tip\nand surface and remaining electrolyte material. Influences\nof a water meniscus on the adhesion play an important role\nbut can be excluded here, due to the dry argon atmosphere.\nUsing a positive bias voltage, the particles showing a low\nadhesion are expected to be \u00adLiFePO4 particles, while the\nhigh adhesion is assigned to binder and electrolyte material\ndue to presence of charges and a higher mechanical pulloff force of the tip from the surface, induced by remaining electrolyte.

In the top of the current images, the average current\nmagnitude of the agglomerate-free surface is given through the conductive nanometer particle network. Zhu\net al. previously observed the appearance of large surface\nagglomerates for cycled \u00adLiMnO2 cathodes [47]. In their\nstudy, the agglomerates are assumed to be generated by fragmentation of particles due to cyclic induced stress by continuous lithiation and delithiation and consecutive agglomeration of nanometer particles, which is in agreement with the\nobserved composition of the agglomerates here. Therefore,\nthe continuous lithiation and delithiation leads to cracking\nand fragmentation of large LFP particles and subsequent\nagglomeration generates the micrometre size agglomerates.\nThe observed lack of conductivity on these agglomerates\nindicates disconnection to the electrode electrical network\nand therefore also a loss of active material due to the generation of an electrochemical inactive phase.\nSince the agglomerates are electrically insulating, the\nquantity of agglomerates controls the overall surface conductivity. The conductivity decreased by 40% to 70% compared to the fresh cathode (see Fig. 9a top). Apart from the\nagglomerates, the surface conductivity is influenced by (i)\nthe isolating surface layer, (ii) degradation of carbon coating and (iii) the contact loss of the particle to the conductive electrode network. The roughness of the cathode surface, which is not covered by the agglomerates, decreased\ncompared to the fresh cathode surface by roughly 25% to\n50% (Fig. 9a bottom).

Since the samples are measured exsitu, the sample preparation process influences the surface\nroughness of the samples. For example Wu et al. used an\nextensive procedure with acetone and ethanol to wash the\ncathode surfaces several times, which presumably removed\nall remaining electrolyte and measured an increase of the\nsurface roughness after ageing [23]. Contrary, we employed\na more delicate procedure with DMC in a single process to\nwash off electrolyte and no further surface treatment for the\nanalysis.\nNevertheless, Kostecki et al. [49] and Demirocak and\nBushan [50] observed likewise a decrease in surface roughness after cyclic and calendric ageing of \u00adLiN0.8Co0.2O2\nand \u00adLiFePO4 cathodes, respectively. While Demirocak\nand Bushan did not elaborate further on this observation,\nKostecki et al. attribute this to the formation of a deposit\nwhich is not enhanced by electrochemical cycling [49].\nThe formation of an electrolyte layer on the cathode surface reduces the surface roughness of the analysed aged\ncathodes. We assume the deposit to exhibit only a thin\nlayer thickness, since the AFM measurements still show a\nmeasurable current in these areas. The observed decrease\nof surface conductivity, which is observed by the reduced\nmagnitude of the measured current in the aged cathode surfaces, is therefore attributed to the degradation of carbon\ncoating on the particle and loss of electrical contact to the\nelectrode conductivity network. The surface layer does not\nseem to electrically isolate the cathode surface, since the\nagglomerate-free cathode surfaces still exhibit a measurable\ncurrent (see also Figure S4 for a higher magnification of\nthe agglomerate-free cathode surface).

The modest reduction of the conductive area in AFM images is attributed to loss of electrical\ncontact of particles to the electrode conductivity network.\nCarbon coating degradation does not influence the surface\nconductivity, but leads to a reduction in the absolute values\nof the current magnitude due to resistance increase of the\nelectrode. The increase of the surface roughness is attributed\nto an inhomogeneous surface layer, which does not cover the\ncathode surface completely, and cracking and fragmentation of LFP particles. This is based on the assumption that\nthicker, homogeneous and complete surface layers are generating a smooth and flat surface layer, while the bare cathode\nand a cathode with only small and limited coverage exhibits\na rough surface, due to the structure of the uncovered LFP\nparticles. The assumption is summarized in the illustration\nin Fig. 9b.

A similar trend is observed for the cathodes\naged at \u2212 20 \u00b0C, which show an almost constant surface\nconductivity within the group after ageing, but differ in the\nremaining cell capacity (Fig. 1). Therefore, the decrease of\nthe cathode surface conductivity does not seem to have a\ndirect impact on the remaining cell capacity. This observation is plotted in Figure S5, which displays the independency\nof the remaining cell capacity on the surface conductive\narea. Next to the cell capacity, the power capabilities, which\nwould be influenced by a resistance increase of the cells, is\nnot affected by the observed reduction of surface conductivity. This observation was reported before by the authors in\nFigure S11 [26], which depicts the evolution of the internal\ncell resistance of the electrodes (called \u00adRtotal).

The roughness follows the same trend as the\nsurface conductivity, with 100% DOD exhibiting a higher\ndecrease of the surface roughness compared to the 50%\nDOD counterpart. The cathodes aged at \u2212 20 \u00b0C exhibit an\nunchanged or a slightly increased surface roughness, which\nshows, that cycling at \u2212 20 \u00b0C generates only very limited\ncoverage of particles upon ageing. The increase of surface\nroughness is due to the cracking and fragmentation of LFP\nparticles, which are subsequently not entirely covered by a\nsurface layer. **3.5 \u0007Chemical compositions of cathode**\n**close\u2011to\u2011surface material and surface layers** The chemical composition of the cathode surface was analysed using EDX and XPS.

The appearance of a higher Fe content on the surface\nof cathodes aged at \u2212 20 \u00b0C, for which no Fe deposition at\nthe anode surfaces is observed, is unexpected. Additionally,\nthe Fe content of the cathode cross-section stays constant or\nincreases slightly (see Fig. 12). The cathodes aged at 55 \u00b0C\nexhibit an increase of the Fe content on the cathode surface and a decrease of the Fe content in the cross-section,\nwhich would be expected for the dissolution of Fe from the\nbulk into the electrolyte. This observation of the Fe content increase on the cathode surface and cross-section for\nthe cathodes aged at \u2212 20 \u00b0C points towards an inhomogeneous Fe redistribution inside the cathode due to ageing,\nsince Fe dissolution towards and deposition on the anode\nis not observed. Phosphorus follows the same mechanism\nas observed for Fe, without the dissolution into the electrolyte, since the P increase on the anode surface is attributed\nto electrolyte salt decomposition and SEI growth. On the\ncathode surfaces, a higher P content after ageing is observed,\nwhile for the cross-section it decreased. This observation\npoints towards a redistribution of P inside the cathode material, as it is assumed for Fe.\nThe XPS spectra of the cathode surfaces show species\nsimilar to the anode surfaces. The C\u2013C and C\u2013H (284 eV)\npeaks are well observable in all samples and their intensities on the bulk surface increase only slightly after ion\netching (Fig. 11, see also Table 2 for peak assignment).\nA similar observation is found in the O1s spectra for the\n\u00adPO43\u2212 peak at 531 eV, which is well observable. The pronounced C\u2013C/C\u2013H and \u00adPO43\u2212 peaks indicate only partial\ncoverage of the cathode surface as already observed in\nthe AFM measurements (Figs. 7 and Fig. 8).

For the cathodes\naged at 55 \u00b0C, P and Fe show a similar trend, with a decrease\nof the P and Fe content for the 50% DOD cycling and a constant or only slight decrease for the cathodes aged with 100%\nDOD. The decrease of the Fe content in the bulk material is\nin agreement with the already observed Fe dissolution from\nthe cathode and migration to and deposition on the anode\nsurface (see Fig. 5). The decrease of the P content in the\ncathode bulk and the increase of the P content on the cathode\nsurface indicate an accumulation of \u00adFePO4 active material in\nthe surface of the electrode and depletion in the bulk of the\ncathode due to cycling. This effect is more pronounced for\nthe cathodes aged at 50% DOD. This effect might be linked\nto the overall completed ageing cycles of the cathode. As\nexplained earlier, the 50% DOD cells completed roughly\ntwice as many charge and discharge cycles compared to\nthe 100% DOD cells. The higher amount of cycles leads to\nan inhomogeneous distribution and accumulation of active\nmaterial near the surface in the cathode. The increase of\nthe vanadium content on the anode surface is accompanied\nby the decrease in the cathode bulk. The decrease does not\nexhibit any distinct dependency on the ageing profile. Transition metal dissolution is therefore not only limited to Fe,\nbut also affects V, a doping agent. The appearance of V dissolution into the electrolyte was already observed by Hovington et al. for \u00adLi1.2V3O8 cathodes [54]. For the cathodes\naged at \u2212 20 \u00b0C, no distinct trend for the elemental changes\nwas detected.

The current intensity (difference from AP1 to AP2) has a smaller influence on\nthe capacity fading than the DOD (see Fig. 1).\nThe anode surfaces aged at 55 \u00b0C show a dense surface layer on the graphite flakes and only to a small extent\nan electrolyte decomposition layer on the anodes aged\nat \u2212 20 \u00b0C. The anodes aged at \u2212 20 \u00b0C, however, reveal\nintense Li plating and the appearance of crystal-like features,\nwhich are presumably LiF crystals. LiF, LiOH and \u00adLi2O\nspecies are observed in the XPS spectra in the anodes aged\nat \u2212 20 \u00b0C, but not at the anodes aged at 55 \u00b0C. Fe resulting from dissolution is well observed on the anodes aged at\n55 \u00b0C, while low temperature cycling completely represses\nFe from dissolution. Nevertheless, V is observed on all\nanode surfaces, independent from temperature, which is similar to the decrease of the V content observed for the cathode\nbulk. The 50% DOD profile shows consistently higher mass\ncontents of P, O and V and Fe (with only one exception at\nAP2 for Fe) compared to the 100% DOD counterpart for\nthe ageing at 55 \u00b0C on the anode, which indicates higher\nelectrolyte decomposition rates due to cycling at higher SOC\nranges. Ageing at \u2212 20 \u00b0C does not show any clear pattern,\nneither in the aged cathode, nor in the aged anode.\nThe cathodes aged at 55 \u00b0C exhibit micrometre size and\nelectrically isolating agglomerates consisting of \u00adLiFePO4\nparticles. Particle cracking, fragmentation and subsequent\nagglomeration of the nanometer particles generate the\nagglomerates. The agglomerates are electrochemically inactive and responsible for loss of active material, next to the\nobserved Fe dissolution from the cathode into the electrolyte. The remaining cathode surface, which is not covered by\nthe agglomerates, shows an overall lower conductivity compared to the fresh cathode, indicating an additional degradation of the carbon coating on the particles and connection\nfrom the particles to the overall electrode electrical network.\nThe surfaces of the cathodes aged at \u2212 20 \u00b0C do not show any\nsurface covering and show no significant change in overall\nsurface conductivity. XPS analysis reveals higher amount\nof traces of \u00adLixPFz at the cathodes surfaces aged at 55 \u00b0C,\nwhile higher amount of traces of \u00adLixPOyFz are observed at\nthe cathodes aged at \u2212 20 \u00b0C. LiF is only observed at the\ncathodes aged at \u2212 20 \u00b0C. The EDX analysis of cathode surfaces show an increase of the mass content of P and Fe on\nthe surface with a decrease of Fe in the bulk for the cathodes\naged at 55 \u00b0C. The 50% DOD profiles show a higher amount\nof Fe decrease in the cathode bulk, which points towards a\nhigher Fe dissolution rate at high SOC cycling.

Loss of lithium inventory is for the cells aged at 55 \u00b0C\nbased on the formation of a surface layer on the anode side.\nFor the cells aged at \u2212 20 \u00b0C, Li plating is likely the main\nsource of loss of lithium inventory, since the formation of a\nsurface layer is observed in a smaller extend. The cathode\naged at 55 \u00b0C exhibits formation of surface agglomerates\nconsisting of active material and Fe dissolution from the\ncathode and deposition on the anode surface. A similar effect\nis not observed for the cathodes aged at \u2212 20 \u00b0C. Therefore,\nthe ageing at 55 \u00b0C is the sum of the anode (loss of lithium\ninventory) and cathode (loss of active material) contribution,\nwhile for the ageing at \u2212 20 \u00b0C, the anode (loss of lithium\ninventory) is the main factor influencing the capacity decay.\nThe key insights of the presented results are summarised\nas following: firstly, we show that next to the temperature,\nthe depth of discharge is another factor influencing the Fe\ndissolution. Secondly, the formation of LiF crystals with\nroughly 500 nm in diameter are observed, but only for the\ncells aged at 55 \u00b0C. Thirdly, structural analyses of the cathode surface show that the surface conductivity is drastically\ndecreased for the cathodes aged at 55 \u00b0C by the evolution\nof micrometer sized, electrically isolated \u00adLiFePO4 agglomerates. However, the reduction of the surface conductivity\ndoes not correlate with the capacity fading, indicating only\na minor influence of electrode surface conductivity on the\noverall capacity fading process. Fourthly, next to the dissolution of iron, vanadium dissolution from the cathode and\ndeposition on the anode is observed, indicating instable doping of \u00adLiFePO4 material. Fifthly, the electrolyte deposition\nspecies on the cathodes exhibit a higher amount of oxygenated species for the ageing at \u2212 20 \u00b0C compared to 55 \u00b0C,\nindicating different decomposition paths. Additionally, the\nresults confirm, that cycling at lower DOD is more detrimental than cycling using the full capacity range [10, 55].\nThe manuscript is linked to another publication [26] on the\ntracking of cell ageing using cell level analysis techniques.\nThe results are supposed to assist in the correct choice of\noperation conditions for these highly used commercial cells\nand cell chemistry and to present the degradation mechanisms related to the ageing. These observations reveal that\ncycling at elevated temperatures and higher SOC levels have\na more detrimental effect on the electrode materials. Cycling\nat \u2212 20 \u00b0C had only little detrimental effects on the cathodes\nand for the anodes it resulted mainly in the occurrence of Li\nplating. The reduction of the surface conductivity does not\nhave any correlation with the remaining capacity, therefore,\nits influence on cell ageing is assumed negligible.",
