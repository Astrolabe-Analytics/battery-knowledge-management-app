However, as is the case with many chemi# L\ncal, mechanical and electronic systems, long battery lifetime entails\ndelayed feedback of performance, often many months to years.\nAccurate prediction of lifetime using early-cycle data would unlock\nnew opportunities in battery production, use and optimization. For\nexample, manufacturers can accelerate the cell development cycle,\nperform rapid validation of new manufacturing processes and sort/\ngrade new cells by their expected lifetime. Likewise, end users could\nestimate their battery life expectancy [4][\u2013][6] . One emerging application\nenabled by early prediction is high-throughput optimization of\nprocesses spanning large parameter spaces (Supplementary Figs. 1\nand 2), such as multistep fast charging and formation cycling, which\nare otherwise intractable due to the extraordinary time required.\nThe task of predicting lithium-ion battery lifetime is critically\nimportant given its broad utility but challenging due to nonlinear\ndegradation with cycling and wide variability, even when controlling for operating conditions [7][\u2013][11] .\nMany previous studies have modelled lithium-ion battery lifetime. Bloom et al. [12] and Broussely et al. [13] performed early work that\nfitted semi-empirical models to predict power and capacity loss.\nSince then, many authors have proposed physical and semi-empirical models that account for diverse mechanisms such as growth of\nthe solid\u2013electrolyte interphase [14][,][15], lithium plating [16][,][17], active material loss [18][,][19] and impedance increase [20][\u2013][22] . Predictions of remaining\nuseful life in battery management systems, summarized in these\nreviews [5][,][6], often rely on these mechanistic and semi-empirical models for state estimation. Specialized diagnostic measurements such\nas coulombic efficiency [23][,][24] and impedance spectroscopy [25][\u2013][27] can\nalso be used for lifetime estimation.

A growing body of literature [6][,][40][,][41] applies\nmachine-learning techniques for predicting the remaining useful\nlife of batteries using data collected in both laboratory and online\nenvironments. Generally, these works make predictions after accumulating data corresponding to degradation of at least 25% along\nthe trajectory to failure [42][\u2013][48] or using specialized measurements at\nthe beginning of life [11] . Accurate early prediction of cycle life with\nsignificantly less degradation is challenging because of the typically\nnonlinear degradation process (with negligible capacity degradation in early cycles) as well as the relatively small datasets used to\ndate that span a limited range of lifetimes [49] . For example, Harris\net al. [10] found a weak correlation ( _\u03c1_ = 0.1) between capacity values\nat cycle 80 and capacity values at cycle 500 for 24 cells exhibiting\nnonlinear degradation profiles, illustrating the difficulty of this task.\nMachine-learning approaches are especially attractive for high-rate\noperating conditions, where first-principles models of degradation\nare often unavailable. In short, opportunities for improving upon\nstate-of-the-art prediction models include higher accuracy, earlier\nprediction, greater interpretability and broader application to a\nwide range of cycling conditions.\nIn this work, we develop data-driven models that accurately\npredict the cycle life of commercial lithium iron phosphate (LFP)/\ngraphite cells using early-cycle data, with no prior knowledge of\ndegradation mechanisms.

In fact, a similar model that uses\ndischarge capacity fade curve data from the first 300 cycles achieves\ncomparable performance (27% and 46% for the primary and\nsecondary test data, respectively), highlighting the difficulty of\nprediction without using voltage features.\nWe also consider contexts in which predictions are required at\nvery low cycle number but the accuracy requirements are less stringent, such as sorting/grading and pack design applications.

In the\nregression setting, we obtain a test error of 9.1% using only the first\n100 cycles; in the classification setting, we obtain a test error of 4.9%\nusing data from the first 5 cycles. This level of accuracy is achieved\nby extracting features from high-rate discharge voltage curves as\nopposed to only from the capacity fade curves, and without using\ndata from slow diagnostic cycles or assuming prior knowledge of\ncell chemistry and degradation mechanisms. The success of the\nmodel is rationalized by demonstrating consistency with degradation modes that do not manifest in capacity fade during early cycles\nbut impact the voltage curves. In general, our approach can complement approaches based on physical and semi-empirical models and\non specialized diagnostics.

The cells have a nominal\ncapacity of 1.1 Ah and a nominal voltage of 3.3 V. The manufacturer\u2019s\nrecommended fast-charging protocol is 3.6 _C_ constant current\u2013constant voltage\n(CC-CV). The rate capability of these cells during charge and discharge is shown\nin Supplementary Fig. 27.\nAll cells were tested in cylindrical fixtures with four-point contacts on\na 48-channel Arbin LBT battery testing cycler. The tests were performed\nat a constant temperature of 30 \u00b0C in an environmental chamber (Amerex\nInstruments). Cell can temperatures were recorded by stripping a small section\nof the plastic insulation and contacting a type T thermocouple to the bare metal\ncasing using thermal epoxy (OMEGATHERM 201) and Kapton tape.\nThe cells were cycled with various candidate fast-charging policies\n(Supplementary Table 9) but identically discharged. Cells were charged from\n0% to 80% state-of-charge (SOC) with one of 72 different one-step and two-step\ncharging policies. Each step is a single _C_ rate applied over a given SOC range;\nfor example, a two-step policy could consist of a 6 _C_ charging step from 0% to\n50% SOC, followed by a 4 _C_ step from 50% to 80% SOC. The 72 charging polices\nrepresent different combinations of current steps within the 0% to 80% SOC range.\nThe charging time from 0% to 80% SOC ranged from 9 to 13.3 min. An internal\nresistance measurement was obtained during charging at 80% SOC by averaging 10\npulses of \u00b13.6 _C_ with a pulse width of 30 or 33 ms, where 1 _C_ is 1.1 A, or the current\nrequired to fully (dis)charge the nominal capacity (1.1 Ah) in 1 h. All cells then\ncharged from 80% to 100% SOC with a uniform 1 _C_ CC-CV charging step to 3.6 V\nand a current cutoff of _C_ /50. All cells were subsequently discharged with a CC-CV\ndischarge at 4 _C_ to 2.0 V with a current cutoff of _C_ /50. The voltage cutoffs used in\nthis work follow those recommended by the manufacturer.\nOur dataset is described in Supplementary Table 9. In total, our dataset\nconsists of three \u2018batches\u2019, or cells run in parallel. Each batch has slightly different\ntesting conditions. For the \u20182017-05-12\u2019 batch, the rests after reaching 80% SOC\nduring charging and after discharging were 1 min and 1 s, respectively. For the\n\u20182017-06-30\u2019 batch, the rests after reaching 80% SOC during charging and after\ndischarging were both 5 min. For the \u20182018-04-12\u2019 batch, 5 s rests were placed after\nreaching 80% SOC during charging, after the internal resistance test and before\nand after discharging.\nA histogram of cycle life for the three datasets is presented in Supplementary\nFig. 28. We note that four cells had unexpectedly high measurement noise and\nwere excluded from analysis.\nTo standardize the voltage\u2013capacity data across cells and cycles, all 4 _C_\ndischarge curves were fitted to a spline function and linearly interpolated\n(Supplementary Fig. 29). Capacity was fitted as a function of voltage and evaluated\nat 1,000 linearly spaced voltage points from 3.5 V to 2.0 V. These uniformly sized\nvectors enabled straightforward data manipulations such as subtraction.",

The average percentage error is defined as = 1 \u2211 _n_ \u2223\u2212\u2223 _yi_ _\u0177i_ _n_ _i_ _i_ % err = 1 \u2211 \u2223\u2212\u2223 _yi_ _\u0177i_ \u00d7 100 (7) _n_ _y_ \u2211",
