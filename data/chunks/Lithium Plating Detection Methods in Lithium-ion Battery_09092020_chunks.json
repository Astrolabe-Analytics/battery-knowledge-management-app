      "text": "**Introduction** Li-ion batteries (LiBs) have been widely used in various applications like electric\nvehicles and energy storage systems, which require great durability and safety. For\npractical applications, fast charge capability of the battery is desired, such as 15 min\ncharging to 80% state of charge (SOC). However, certain charging conditions are known\nto provoke Li plating which can impact safety. [[1-6]] Li plating is an undesired side reaction\non the anode side of Li-ion batteries. Li ions are reduced to metallic Li instead of\nintercalating into the anode crystal structure. Deposition of metallic Li also enables\ndendrite formation. This occurs where the local anode potential drops down to 0 V vs.\nLi/Li [+] . In the presence of local inhomogeneity of the graphite anode surface, Li plating\ncan be localized [[7, 8]] . It can also be induced by slow intercalation kinetics and high SEI\n(Solid Electrolyte Interface) film resistances in the anode, due to low temperatures or high\ncurrent rates [[9, 10]] as well as by a slow diffusion processes [[11, 12]] . A poorly designed cell or\nwrong charging protocols may also cause Li plating. Anode material type influences Li\nplating due to the differences in equilibrium potential; Li titanate is the least affected by Li\nplating and hard carbon is better than graphite [[10, 13]] . Similarly, electrolyte composition\nalso affects the low-temperature performance of Li-ion batteries [[9, 14-16]] . In general, the\ndeposited metallic Li is reversible. However, during oxidation, Li dendrites can lose\ncontact with the active material, leading to dead Li in the cell [[17]] . Furthermore, the plated\nmetallic Li is highly reactive and forms and irreversible SEI with the electrolyte [[18, 19]] . Both,\nthe dead Li as well as its SEI, lead to a fast capacity fade of the battery. Therefore,\nmeasurement of cell capacity and resistance serve as the direct way to detect Li plating.\nDifferent studies suggest that metallic Li deposited on a graphite electrode is partly\nreversible. It has been reported that deposited Li can re-intercalate into the graphite during\nrelaxation of the electrode. [[11, 20]] Oxidation (\u2018stripping\u2019) of metallic Li was observed during",

(2) Battery\ndestructive physical analysis and imaging of anode. [[28, 29]] (3) Electron Paramagnetic\nResonance (EPR) [[30, 31]] and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) [[32, 33]] to detect a\nparticular range of resonance frequency corresponding to metallic Li.

Among the above methods, voltage plateau is the most feasible method for online\ndetection of Li plating in real-world applications, as it is nondestructive and does not\nrequire special and expensive equipment. Prior works demonstrated the feasibility of\nadopting voltage plateau as a method for Li plating detection. Therefore, mathematical\nmodels have been extensively applied to predict performance and life of LiBs and gain\nfundamental insights into the internal cell characteristics. [[49-56]] Several works have been\nreported to study Li plating during overcharge [[57, 58]] or during charge at high rates and/or\nlow temperatures [[33, 59]], and to study the capacity loss induced by Li plating [[60]] . Most of\nthese models only considered Li plating process and neglected Li stripping process; thus,\ncannot capture the voltage plateau behavior. Hein and Latz [[61-64]] attempted to simulate Li\nstripping and the associated voltage plateau behavior, using a 3D microscopic model.

      "text": "3 **Discussion** Three Electrode Diagnostics During charging at low temperatures, high rates, and high states of charge, the\ndeposition of metallic Li on anodes occurs which leads to rapid battery aging and failure. [[11, ] 19, 21, 34, 65-69] This Li deposition on anodes can be detected in battery cells with a reference\nelectrode. [[19, 65, 68, 70]] However, commercial cells in automotive or consumer electronics\napplications do not contain a reference electrode. Recently, much work has been done using\na three-electrode setup (i.e. anode, cathode, and reference.) [[68, 70-72]] Bhardwaj [[70]] used a Li reference electrode built into a cell to investigate a charging\nstrategy to avoid Li deposition on anodes. Zhang [[68]] utilized a reference electrode while\ninvestigating a stepwise charging procedure with reduced current at the beginning of\ncharging followed by a higher current. Itou [[71]] collected electrodes from aged cells and\nreconstructed them together with a Li reference electrode and were able to determine the\nresistances of the anode and the cathode versus the reference separately. Waldmann [[73]]\nconstructed three-electrode cells from commercial 18650s with the addition of a Li\nreference electrode. This allowed for the measurement of the anode potential against the\nLi reference during charging of the reconstructed cells and determination of Li deposition.\nWaldmann observed from anode potential measurement that Li deposition on anodes in\ncommercial cells is possible even at ambient temperature and low charge rates. Koch [[74]] has also done work on three electrode setups. These offer the ability to\nmonitor the onset of Li plating in an electric vehicle and link with controller logic in a\nbattery management system. However, to date, this type of reference electrode setup has\nnot been seen in a vehicle application. Commercial cells in automotive or consumer\nelectronics applications do not contain a reference electrode. Moreover, the location of a\nreference electrode should be carefully controlled to measure resistances at each electrode\nand solid-state diffusion rates. Measurement of Coulombic Efficiency There are two kinds of Li plating, reversible and irreversible. Reversible Li plating\ndescribes deposited Li that is in electrical contact with the negative electrode. Therefore,\nreversibly plated Li is stripped during the discharge step, i.e. \ud835\udc44\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc54 = \ud835\udc44\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc63,\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc54 [CE1]",

In contrast, irreversibly plated Li exhibits only fragile\nelectrical contact with the negative electrode. Such Li may become electrically isolated\nfrom the graphite electrode during the stripping process. Irreversible plating, i.e. dead Li,\nis thus mainly responsible for the capacity losses during low temperature charging with\nhigh currents. [[21]]",

[[75]] The plated Li can grow\nthrough the SEI and react with the electrolyte. [[11]] Subsequent surface film formation causes\ncapacity losses which are not distinguishable from irreversible plating. Moreover, the\nformation of such surface films can also cause electrical isolation of deposited Li.

      "text": "Reversibility \u201cR\u201d of the plating process can be determined by the quantitative\ndetection method. The reversibility shows maxima at medium SOC and decreases towards\nhigh SOC. At high SOC, the following processes can take place: formation of fragile Li\ndeposit, subsequent chemical intercalation of some of the plated Li, and surface film\nformation on the residual plated Li. These processes lead to poor electrical pathway and\neventual isolation of fragile Li deposit during Li stripping. Such dead Li cannot be stripped\nand is therefore electrochemically inactive, i.e. the reversibility is reduced. At low SOC,\nan unknown degradation mechanism leads to capacity losses in addition to Li plating. At a\ngiven SOC, reversibility is reduced with decreasing temperature. Li plating increases at\nlower temperatures due to kinetic polarization effects. Thus, more plated Li is prone to lose\nits electrical contact with the graphite electrode, which aggravates irreversible plating and\nreduces the reversibility. The coulombic efficiency CE describes the ratio between\ndischarge and charge during one cycle, i.e. CE = Qdc/Qch. It typically illustrates capacity\nlosses during charging, e.g. SEI formation at ambient temperatures. CE at low temperatures\ncan be understood by the following equation, CE = (Qch-Qirrev.plating)/Qch. Thus, the\ncoulombic efficiency exhibits a contrary SOC dependence compared to irreversible plating\nfor constant temperature. In a plot of SOC vs CE, a linear SOC dependence of the plated\nLi mass is observed for low to medium SOC values. Decreasing temperature leads to\nhigher Li plating growth rates and shifts the plating initiation point to lower SOC which\nmeans that the plating process starts earlier. Both results are attributed to increased kinetic\neffects. This method is suitable for all cathode materials without a pronounced voltage\nplateaus in the discharge profile. It is crucial that the stripping plateau is clearly identifiable\nand not overlain by plateaus of the cathode material. High Precision Coulometry As we saw in the previous section, when Li plating occurs during cycling, the\ncoulombic efficiency of the cell will decrease. Based on this premise, Li plating should be\ndetectable as small changes to the coulombic efficiency of cells cycling at different rates.\nThis implies that the detection limits for Li plating will be dictated by the precision and\naccuracy of measurements of the coulombic efficiency. A High Precision Charger [[34, 77]]\nshould therefore have a high degree of sensitivity for detecting Li plating in any cell type\nunder standard cycling conditions.

A class \u201cA\u201d\nresistance temperature detector (RTD) (US Sensor, PPG101A1) was attached to the cells\nto measure variations in cell temperature at high rates. After cycling, cells were discharged\nto 0 V (to ensure safety while opening) and opened to look for evidence of Li plating on\nthe negative electrode. The coulombic efficiency (CE) was time normalized to compare\ncells that are in the time (h) dependent regime. The coulombic inefficiency normalized over\ntime (CIE/h) shows all cells at low rates fall on the same curve indicating, they are in a\npurely time dependent degradation regime which agrees well with the previous work from\nSmith _et al_ . [[78, 79]] However, when charging at 1C or higher the CIE/h becomes worse than\nthose cells in the time dependent regime indicating the occurrence of Li plating. Based on\nthe work of Smith _et al_ . [[78, 79]] it was shown that normally parasitic reactions are\npredominantly time dependent and cycle independent. The only exception is parasitic\nreactions on Silicon negative electrodes which are expected to be strongly cycle dependent\ndue to the large volume changes during each cycle. Therefore, the increase in CIE/h must\nbe attributed to Li plating as it is a cycle dependent degradation mode. As can be seen in\nFigure 1, with increasing rate, the amount of Li plating/stripping increases, and the CIE/h\ngets worse. Figure 1.

      "text": "6 From this data it can be seen when Li plating occurs it causes an increase in the\ndegradation rate of the cells. The cells charged at a 5C rate lessen their capacity loss rate\naround 200 hours (near 170 mAh of remaining capacity) which is likely due to the large\ndifference in over potential of the negative electrode relative to the positive electrode.\nWhen the cell is reaching the upper cutoff potential of 4.2 V, the state of charge of the\ngraphite is significantly less than in the early cycles (hence the lower full cell capacity). As\ngraphite is not being charged to as high an electrode state of charge, the voltage curve of\nthe graphite no longer reaches 0 V vs Li/Li [+] to initiate Li plating even with the same\noverpotential from the high current. Figure 2 shows the results for CIE/h as a function of charge rate at different\ntemperatures. Coulombic efficiency and CIE/h are taken as an average over the final \u223c50\nhours of cycling while fade is taken as a linear fit to the capacity versus time data over that\nsame final \u223c50 hours. Figure 2 shows that the CIE/h for cells cycled at lower rates at a\ngiven temperature is a constant. At lower temperature this constant is smaller as the\ndegradation rate is less (than at higher temperature) due to the slower rate of parasitic\nreactions. However, as the rate is increased, the CIE/h begins to deviate from the low-rate\nconstant value and becomes larger (worse). This leads to \u201ckinks\u201d in the CIE/h versus rate\ncurves where CIE/h is constant during the time dependent regime and then increases with\nrate during the charge rate dependent regime (where Li plating occurs). The \u201ckinks\u201d\nindicate the charge rate at which Li plating begins at that temperature. There are measurable\ndifferences in the fade rates (especially when the efficiency becomes very poor at high\nrates) but the difference in fade rates is so small that it is much easier to resolve the onset\nof plating by examining the CIE/h. They confirmed Li plating in their study, by opening\nthe cells after cycling at different rates at \u223c50% state of charge and inspecting the anodes,\nin an argon-filled glove box. Figure 2.

The\nvoltage plateau can occur either at the beginning of discharge or of relaxation after charging.\nAmong the various methods, voltage plateau is the most feasible method for online\ndetection of Li plating in real-world applications, as it is nondestructive and does not\nrequire special and expensive equipment. Smart _et al_ . [[9, 41]] were among the first to apply\ndischarge voltage plateau after low temperature (-40 \u00b0C) charging as a tool for Li plating\ndetection and proposed that the length of plateau can be used as a measure of deposited Li\nmetal amount. Petzl and Danzer [[21]] presented a differential voltage approach to detect and\nquantify Li plating. In their tests, a cell was charged with 1C rate at < -20 \u00b0C and discharged\nimmediately after charging. A voltage plateau appeared at the beginning of discharge. Later,\nUhmann _et al_ . [[22]] proposed to detect voltage plateau during relaxation (rest time after\ncharging) rather than during discharge, which is advantageous as the cell has no net current\nat open-circuit, making the plateau more pronounced and easier to detect. The advantage\nof analyzing dV/dt during post charge relaxation is that data could be easily collected\nimmediately after charging, or by turning off a fraction of the vehicle LiB packs during the\nfirst few minutes of driving. In their work by Uhlmann _et al_ . [[22]] the Open Circuit Voltage\n(OCV) after charge showed plated Li can chemically intercalate into graphite when the cell\nis at rest. The process of Li plating followed by intercalation into graphite gives rise to a\ncharacteristic \u2018dual plateau\u2019 OCV feature, which is highlighted in Figure 3. [[80]] This plateau\nwas interpreted as mixed potential resulting from the interplay of Li intercalation and\ndissolution of deposited metallic Li on the anode surface. The first potential plateau during\nrelaxation corresponds to the mixed potential of the plated Li and lithiated graphite (LixC6).\nAs the plated Li chemically intercalates, the mixed Li/LixC6 potential transitions to a pure\nLixC6 potential after a threshold amount of surface Li has been depleted. This phenomena\nis more prominent as a voltage derivative (Figure 3, Dotted line), which is first proposed\nby Schindler _et al_ . [[23]] While differential OCV (dV/dt) have been used by many groups to\nstudy Li plating, the experimental study was either limited to cold temperatures (\u2264 0\u00b0C) or\ncharging to high graphite states of charge (SOC).

These results indicate that\nthe time to reach dV/dt peak can be used for assessing the Li plating amount in different\ntests. The rate of Li stripping is affected by the capability of Li [+] intercalation into graphite\nand by the rate of Li [+] diffusion and migration from the separator to the foil. In addition to voltage relaxation (dV/dt), another widely reported technique for\nelectrochemical Li detection is differential voltage analysis of the discharge profile (dV/dQ\nor dQ/dV). In the plot of derivative of voltage over capacity (dV/dQ), a distinct peak\nappeared at the beginning of discharge. This peak indicates the end of Li metal stripping,\nand the discharge capacity at the dV/dQ peak corresponds to the total amount of Li plated\nduring charging. This method can estimate the amount of plated Li based on the length of\nthe plateau.

Li Plating Modeling Due to the detrimental effects that Li plating can have on battery performance, a\npush to develop mathematical methods to predict the onset of metallic Li growth has been\nseen in recent years. These numerical approaches through modeling offer a way to quantify\nthe amount of plated Li which may offer a clearer picture into the extent of Li plating\ncompared to the experimental in-situ and ex-situ methodologies, and offer the ability to be\nloaded into controllers [[82, 83]] to provide an electrochemical model for in-vehicle\napplications. Arora and White may have been the first to propose a set of equations that\ndescribe the Li deposition reaction at overcharge. [[57]] These equations were coupled with\ntraditional porous electrode theory as detailed by Newman and colleagues. [[84-91]]\nRegarding Li transport in a Li ion battery, Li is assumed to transport from the solid\nmatrix of one active material (such as the anode) governed by transport properties of the\nactive material and reacts at the interface between the active material and the electrolyte\ngoverned by the electrochemical kinetics. Li salt in the electrolyte diffuses from one porous\nelectrode, through a separator, to another porous electrode, governed by the liquid phase\ntransport of the electrolyte. At the interface of the second electrode (such as the cathode)\nand the electrolyte, the Li reacts and intercalates into the solid phase. Traditional porous\nelectrode theory governs these reaction and transport phenomena as is briefly detailed\nbelow. It is assumed that Ohm\u2019s law holds in the solid phase of a porous electrode \ud835\udc561 = \u2212\ud835\udf0e\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc53 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udf191 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udf191 \ud835\udc561 = \u2212\ud835\udf0e\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc53 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc651 [M1] with boundary conditions such that charge is maintained and current flows from one porous\nelectrode to another.

More recently, Baker and Verbrugge have developed a Multi-Species, MultiReaction (MSMR) Model [[104-108]] for porous intercalation electrodes that has been applied\nto plating and dissolution of Li in a Li ion cell [[108]] . In the latter work, a set of equations was\nderived to describe the overcharge of a Li ion cell. Two critical additions to published\nmodels were added to address Li plating. First, the handling of Li deposition and\ndissolution electrochemical reactions was addressed. Secondly, the plated Li in system can\ndirectly interact with the vacant sites in the anode, which will impact the system response.\nBy including these theoretical developments with the MSMR model, the authors were able\nto illustrate Li intercalation and plating within a single particle model. One critical\nobservation regarding the thermodynamics of the Li plating reactions shows that the open\ncircuit voltage of the plating reaction with respect to a Li reference cannot be zero, as\ncommonly assumed. Rather, it is only zero when the surface coverage of plated Li is large\nenough for the Li to interact with the electrolyte in the same manner as a bulk metallic Li\nelectrode. Consequentially, when small surface coverages of Li on the surface of the anode\nparticles exists, the plated Li interacts with the anode active material, resulting the OCV of\nthe plated Li being positive, which the authors detail in Eq. 11 in Ref. [[108]] . This provides\nan update to the historical assumption of Li deposition at 0V vs a Li reference.\nIn the Multi-Species, Multi-Reaction (MSMR) Model [[104-108]] a few parameters can\nbe associated with the physical chemistry of the intercalation material enabling a\nquantitative fit of the open-circuit potential. In this model, different galleries of intercalated\nLi are assumed to be in thermodynamic equilibrium, so that their open circuit potentials\nare equal to some common equilibrium potential of the intercalation material.

The simulation scenario used for this case study is C/10 charging at ambient\ntemperature, 20\u00b0C. To illustrate the Li plating condition in simulation scenario a step like\nadditive C/5 charging input current component was used to the positive electrode of the\nplant-model. This additive input current causes a sudden change in current density in the\npositive electrode, while the current density in the negative electrode is kept constant. This\nessentially represents a loss in active Li-ions, as the Li-ion extraction rate from the positive\nelectrode would be higher than the insertion rate in the negative electrode. In this case study,\nthe positive electrode current density increases at t = 600 s. Using this approach, the bulk\nSOC could be tracked even after the occurrence of the plating.

EIS is\nshown in Figure 4a. in which the high-frequency region (761 Hz) is caused by the ionic\nconduction through the electrolyte and electronic conduction through the current collectors\nwhose impedances are represented by ZEL and Z\u03a9 respectively. In the mid-frequency region,\ncharge transfer limitations (CTL) are caused by the electrode-electrolyte interfaces, ZCTL\nand the ion migration through the SEI layer, ZSEI. The low-frequency part is usually\ncharacterized by a 45 \u00b0 slope, arising from the solid diffusion limitations (SDL) in the\nelectrodes. Figure 4b. shows the equivalent circuit of a Li-ion battery. In figure 4b, the\nimpedance due to solid diffusion limitations are referred to as ZSDL,NE or ZSDL,PE, and the\ncorresponding electrode surface potential is represented by VNE,S or VPE,S; NE and PE\nstands for negative and positive electrodes, respectively. Figure 4c shows the EIS plots of\nthe same cell at different SOC levels. As it can be observed [[39, 40, 175, 176]], during\ncharge/discharge, impedance in the mid-frequency range varies with SOC. Both ZCTL and\nZSEI contribute to this range. As no significant change in the SEI layer thickness is expected\nin a single charge/discharge cycle [[177, 178]] the mid-frequency impedance variations can be\nattributed largely to the ZCTL. The electrochemical models that describes the CTL through\nthe Butler-Volmer equation [[21, 155, 179, 180]] also support this rationale. At low and high and\nhigh lithiation levels (0% and 100%), ZCTL is high and reduces as the lithiation level moves\ntowards 50%. Therefore, the impedance changes in the mid-frequency region comes\nmainly from the ZCTL and tracking the battery impedance should indicate the way ZCTL is\nchanging while the battery is being charged or discharged. The impedance measured at the\ntransition frequency (referred as ftr which is marked with \u201c*\u201d in Figure 4c) at which\nimpedance changes to 45\u00b0 slope allows quantifying the total impedance from both the high\nand the mid-frequency regions.

Therefore, charging conditions\nthat allow lithiation levels closer to their average can produce a ZTR profile similar to\nFigure 4d where the lithiation differences in the electrode particles are deemed to be\nnegligible. Conversely, at high C-rates of charging or at low temperatures, the lithiation\nincrease on negative electrode because of reduced solid diffusion. Therefore, at high Crates ZCTL decreases at a lower SOC level compared to charging at low C-rates or high\ntemperatures. With further charging, lithiation tends to increase towards a full lithiation\nlevel, as the negative electrode voltage comes closer to Li reference potential much before\nthe battery reaches 100% SOC. Besides, the potential drop due to charge transfer\nlimitations increases with increasing C-rate or decreasing temperature. The negative\nelectrode potential can fall below the Li reference where Li plating commences. Once Li\nplating begins, electrode lithiation rise and ZCTL decreases since the charging current is\nnow divided into intercalating current and Li plating current. Additionally, as discussed\nwithin Ref.

As a result, the overall impedance at the NE drops after the onset\nof Li plating. On this basis, tracking the ZTR will allow detecting the onset of Li plating\nduring the charge event. In the case of a charging event without Li plating, ZTR follows\nthe curve from Figure 4d where it faces continuously decreasing reduction at lower SOC\nlevels to reach a near flat level in the mid-SOC range and then accelerate as SOC rises\ntowards 100%. In the case of a charging event with Li plating, ZTR faces a second\ndowntrend after the onset of Li plating because of the introduction of parallel impedance\n(ZCTL,li) across the existing ZCTL,NE. Detecting this second downward trend by tracking the\nZTR shall, therefore, indicate the onset of Li plating. Figure 5 shows ZTR as a function of\nrate for test temperature of 20\u00b0C.",

[[36, 40, 54, 175, ] 182] Tracking the ZCTL and thus detecting Li plating may, therefore, become difficult in such\ncases. To track the ZTR under the scenarios of minimal cooling, the cells from test case D\nare charged in a large room maintained at 20 \u00b1 2 \u00b0 C, but with no active thermal\nmanagement. In each charge event, different C-rates are applied with pulse interruption\nprocedure starting from 0.2C to 1.25C. Figures 5a and 5b shows the ZTR profiles and cell\nsurface temperature variations on a cell at different charging C-rates. The ZTR profile at\n0.2C where the temperature rise is within +1 \u00b0 C is similar to the one observed with active\ncooling. With the increase of C-rate, the effect of Li plating on ZTR profiles is clearly\nobserved even with a temperature rise higher than 8 \u00b0 C for charge rates \uf0b3 1C. The ability\nto detect Li plating using the ZTR profiles while temperature is also changing can be\nexplained as follows. As seen from the inset plot in Figure 5b for 1C charge rate, the\nmajority of the temperature rise (circa 5 \u00b0 C rise of the total 8.2 \u00b0 C) occurred during the\nfirst 10 min of the charging process and then the rate of temperature increase is reduced to\ncirca 3.2 \u00b0 C rise over the next 39 min. The authors ascribed the applicability of EIS method\nfor Li plating under minimal cooling as follows: since Li plating typically occurs towards\nthe end of CC charging where temperature changes are not assumed to be significant,\ntemperature influence on the internal processes may be limited. Therefore, for the selected\ncell type and C-rates, Li-plating detection using the ZTR profiles is possible even under\nenvironmental conditions where temperature is increased during the charge process.

      "text": "Cell Thickness Measurement Bitzer and Grule [[36]] successfully employed cell thickness measurement to detect\nLi plating. It is based on the concept of anode (and cell) volume expansion. During the LiB\ncharge/discharge process, the active materials vary in volume, depending on the degree of\nLi-ion intercalation. Graphite anodes, for example, gain about 10% in volume while\nchanging from the de-lithiated elementary state to fully lithiated LiC6 [[185]] . On the other\nhand, the cathode materials have a much smaller dilatation coefficient, for example, it is\nabout 1% for NMC [[186]] . Therefore, generally the thickness of LiB is governed by the anode\nvolume change. One exception is Li titanate anode (LTO), which has a negligible volume\nchange of only 0.1% - 0.3% [[186, 187]] . During charging, Li occupies the interstitials into the\ngraphite lattice. Hence, the volume of the intercalation compound is smaller than the\nvolume of the two separate materials. Li plating on the anode surface instead of\nintercalating into the anode leads to an additional gain in the overall volume. On the\ncontrary, the de-intercalation from the cathode has no significant effect on the cell\nthickness.

According to Equation [C3], an amount of 1 Ah of plated Li causes a gain in\nvolume of Vexp (1 Ah) = 0.37 cm [3] . Using this equation, it is possible to calculate the\nthickness of plated Li, knowing the surface area of electrode in the LiB. Thus, accurate\nmeasurement of cell thickness can serve to identify the onset of Li plating. Change of cell\nthickness during standard cycling showed that the volume change due to Li intercalation\ninto graphite takes place in three steps with different slopes which is highly reproducible.\nWhen the battery is charged with high enough high current to cause Li plating, cell\nthickness increase could be observed. If the cell is at rest after plating, part of the plated Li\nintercalates into the graphite, causing some decrease in thickness. However, if excessive\ncurrent is used, then the thickness growth persists indicating irreversible plating. However, there are some practical challenges that affect the measurement accuracy.\nDue to cell inhomogeneity, dendritic deposition and gas evolution, the actual measured\nvalue is expected to be larger. Charging the cell with continuous currents leads to shifts in\nthe \uf044 cell thickness vs Ah curve. Similarly, measurement temperature can interfere with\naccuracy. However, at a temperature increase of 1 K at the cell surface the thermal\nexpansion is smaller than the resolution of the dial thickness indicator. In addition to the\ntemperature effect, the measurement point of thickness causes also affects measurement\naccuracy. Due to an existing inhomogeneity within every cell, the position of the\nmeasurement point plays a crucial role. Many pouch cells are known to start plating in a\nnarrow area next to the cell\u2019s margin. When choosing the wrong measurement point, the\nexperiment could therefore fail to detect the onset of Li plating. The best point is always\ncell specific and must be determined prior to the thickness measurements, e.g., by opening\nthe cell. Pouch cells especially have problems arising from Gas evolution originating from\nside reactions which interfere with accurate thickness measurement. Applying pressure on\nthe cell by using appropriate spring can mitigate the problem and reduce the error. It was\nshown that during standard cycling other influences like the cathode expansion,\ntemperature or gas evolution are small.",

Generally, the anode from the plated cell is inspected by one or more\nof the following techniques such as optical microscope, SEM, TEM, AFM, XPS, Raman\netc. One challenge with these _ex situ_ techniques is, the plated Li can also intercalate back\ninto the graphite which sometimes makes it challenging to visually observe microscopic Li\nplating. Moreover, this method is conducted ex-situ which can introduce sample\npreparation error. Nevertheless, optical detection methods are effective tools to identify Li\nplating, its morphology and composition. SEM investigations [[188]] enable the analysis of plated Li and dendrites by both _in_\n_situ_ and _ex situ_ . Gireaud _et al_ . [[189]] observed dendrite growth on a Li surface at 20\u00b0C in\nLi/Li-coin cells _ex situ_ . Their work showed the influence of the surface structure on the\ndendrite growth. In contrast, Sagane _et al_ . [[188]] analyzed dendrite growth on copper under\nvacuum inside an in-situ SEM cell with a Li/LiPON/LATP/LiPON/Cu-configuration. They\ncorrelated the dendrite size with the applied current density. High current densities led to\nthe formation of many small dendrites; low current densities led to the formation of fewer\nbut larger dendrites. Steiger _et al_ studied the growth of mossy Li by _in situ_ light microscope\nand _ex situ_ SEM.

[[40]] Copyright (2014), with permission from Elsevier. Zinth _et al_ investigated the transformation of LiC12 to LiC6 during the charging\nprocess in detail. [[40]] Intensities of the signal reflection of each of the two phases were\nanalyzed, as described in Figure 6. It was shown that the loss of cyclable Li was\nsignificantly increasing for higher charge currents, when cells were operated at subambient temperatures of -20 \u00b0C, indicating that a considerable amount of Li has been\ndeposited on the anode's surface. During a following rest period, the signal intensities of\nboth phases changed, indicating a continuous intercalation of Li into the host structure,\neven after the applied current has been switched off. [[40]] When the graphite anode is lithiated to more than 50%, the two existing phases\nLiC6 and LiC12, commonly denoted as stage 1 and stage 2 in literature, show characteristic\nreflections at scattering angles 2 \uf071 for the LiC6 (001) at 33.53\u00b0 and for the LiC12 (002) at\n35.04\u00b0. The intensity of the Bragg reflections increases with increasing share of the\nrespective phase. Therefore, diffraction data in the range of 30\u00b0- 40\u00b0 2 \uf071 were collected in\n2 min throughout the experiment to follow simultaneously the strong (002) reflection of\ngraphite and the similarly prominent reflections of the intercalation compounds LiC12 and\nLiC6 during the charging and relaxation. The integral intensity of the reflections was\nextracted by pseudo Voigt fitting of the data. In case of overlapping reflections, the full\nwidth at half maximum (FWHM) was refined once for all reflections.",

It can be observed that the amount of plating Li correlates nonlinearly with the\ncharging rate, whereas a charging current of C/2 leads to a deposited amount of Li of 5.5%\nand a current of 1C to 9.0% of the charged capacity. Above a threshold current of C/5, Li\nplating increases dramatically. The results indicate that the intercalation rate of reversibly\ndeposited Li seems to be constant, independent of the deposited amount, and that the\nduration of the voltage plateau during the relaxation period can be used as an indicator for\ndeposited Li.

Sample temperature variations alter the kinetics of redox processes and material\nproperties that influence mass transport such as electrolyte viscosity. These temperature\nvariations can permit undesirable outcome such as Li plating and excessive solidelectrolyte interphase (SEI) growth. Low temperatures, high charging rates (C-rates), and\nspatial thermal gradients are known to enable Li plating [[46]] . High temperatures accelerate\nSEI growth and diminish performance. On the cell level, a measure for cell safety is the\nonset temperature of exothermic reactions in accelerated rate calorimetry (ARC) tests. In\nARC tests, cells are heated step-by-step under quasi-adiabatic conditions until exothermic\nreactions are detected (heat-wait-seek experiment). Carter el evaluated three fully charged cells by ARC to assess their thermal\nrunaway [[220]] . One cell was conventionally cycled equilibrium 20 `\u25e6` C and it began to selfheat at 130\u00b0C.

A single charging of a commercial\nLi-ion battery while its temperature is decreasing temporally toward 0 `\u25e6` C, is enough to\ncause Li plating and early loss of capacity, earlier onset temperature of thermal runaway,\nand higher heat generation temperature during thermal runaway. The 18650 cells examined\nshow evidence that approximately half of the Li [+] ions transferred in this first charge deposit\nas Li metal rather than intercalating in both the mild transient 10 to 0 `\u25e6` C and the more\nsubstantial transient 40 to 0 `\u25e6` C cases.

Low temperatures do not lead to Li deposition in all cases, however, if certain\nlimits of SOC and/or charging C-rate are exceeded. For example, a cell might be charged\nby high currents at low SOC and later by lower currents without Li deposition. At low\ntemperatures, the Li deposition might be suppressed by low charging currents or by\npreheating of batteries. Variations can be observed when inhomogeneities/gradients are\npresent inside the cells: temperatures, SOCs and current densities. Such variations can lead\nto a variety of macroscopic morphologies for Li deposition, including, homogeneous Li",

Besides these evidences for Li metal deposition in Li-ion cells, a variety nondestructive and destructive methods exist which are based on ageing behavior, analysis of\nelectrochemical data, cells, and electrodes. Besides ageing mechanisms, Li deposition is\nalso connected to safety mechanisms. Two main safety mechanisms were identified\nincluding, internal shorts caused by the dendritic growth of Li and exothermic reactions\nof Li with electrolyte The dendritic growth of Li is connected to the Li/Li [+] interaction on\nthe atomic level, the presence of ridges, and higher field densities at the tips of the dendrites.\nBesides the very low probability of failures due to Li dendrites in Li-ion cells (ppm range)\nthey are relevant, and some attempts have been made for failsafe designs and early\ndetection of dendrites. Exothermic reactions of Li metal with electrolyte can already start\nat 30\u201335 \u00b0C under the adiabatic conditions of ARC tests. In an application this translates\nto a situation, when not enough heat can be transferred from the cell to the surroundings,\ni.e. for a very high thermal isolation. This shows the importance of cooling systems for\nbatteries in applications.",

      "text": "It is challenging to sensitively and quantitatively detect anode Li plating in practical\nLiBs, which is significant for battery management systems. The cause of anode Li plating\ndepends strongly on the cell design and operating conditions, especially charge rate and\ntemperature. During high-rate charging at room temperature, the poor solid phase diffusion\nof Li ions is responsible for anode Li plating. As the temperature decreases, the interface\nreaction is also hindered in addition to solid phase Li diffusion. In order to suppress anode\nLi plating, optimizing the electrolyte composition and modifying the graphite surface\nstructure by methods such as coating, and doping are usually employed. In addition,\nappropriate working conditions and charging protocols can reduce the possibility of anode\nLi plating. A recent report from Yang _et al_ [[234]] described the performance of self-heating\nLiB structure which has thin nickel (Ni) foils embedded inside a cell that can create\nimmense and uniform heating. The Ni foil is an inherent component of a single cell along\nwith electrodes and electrolyte. It serves as an internal heating element, as well as an\ninternal temperature sensor as its electrical resistance varies linearly with temperature. The\nNi foils only adds 0.5% weight and 0.04% cost to a conventional LiB single cell. They\nwere able demonstrate fast charging without Li plating at temperatures as low as -50 [o] C\nwith the help of the self-heating element. Various techniques have been applied to detect anode Li plating. Among these,\nphysical characterizations such as Conduction EPR, neutron diffraction and mass\nspectrometric titration are promising for understanding the mechanisms of Li plating, while\nelectrochemical methods such as coulombic efficiency, discharge voltage profiles,\nelectrochemical impedance and cell thickness analysis are more applicable to practical\nLiBs The following table provides the Li detection methods, their advantages and current\nchallenges:",
