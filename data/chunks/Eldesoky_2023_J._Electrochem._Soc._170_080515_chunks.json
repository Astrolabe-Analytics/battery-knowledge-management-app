We share long-term cycling results (12000 h) at 40 \u00b0C for NMC811, NMC532, and NMC640 cells cycled with different\nupper cut-off voltages (UCV), C-rates, and depths of discharge (DOD). We show that cycling to a greater UCV results in more\ncapacity loss and resistance growth as expected. However, NMC811 suffered from 5\u201310 times greater resistance growth at 4.20 V\ncompared to 4.06 V, while the resistance for NMC532 and NMC640 cycled to 4.30 V was roughly twice that of the 4.10 V UCV\ncells. This highlights a challenging problem with Ni-rich materials that can be mitigated if the UCV is limited to avoid NMC811\nvolume change. Finally, we used competitive graphite materials reported in previous work to examine the impact of UCV on the\nrate of SEI growth in NMC811 cells, which was found to increase with temperature and UCV, particularly at \u2a7e4.08 V UCV. We\nhope this brief report will highlight the importance of lifetime energy output, rather than initial energy density, and encourage\nbattery users to limit the UCV of Ni-rich cells when possible.\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

[1] However, Ni-rich NMC materials experience a\nlarge lattice volume collapse upon delithiation. [2] This large volume\nchange can expose fresh, reactive particle surfaces to the electrolyte\nwhich increase the parasitic reactions between the positive electrode\nand the electrolyte, increase cell resistance, and result in rapid\ncapacity fade. [3] Moreover, Ni-rich materials such as NMC811 are\nknown to release lattice oxygen past 80% state of charge (SOC) that\ncan result in electrolyte oxidation. [4] While Ni-rich cells cycled to\nhigh SOC benefit from a competitive energy density compared\nto other positive electrode materials, the degradation of these materials\neventually results in lower energy output per cycle compared to lower\nSOC counterparts. [4][\u2013][6] There have been many strategies employed, with\nvarying degrees of success, to address these well-known issues with\nNi-rich materials such as the use of coatings, dopants, core-shell\nparticle design, single crystalline (SC) particle morphologies, and\nelectrolyte additives. [1][,][5][,][7][\u2013][10] Despite these research efforts, the lifetime of Ni-rich materials is\nstill compromised at high SOCs. Previous work from our group\nlooked at the impact of C-rate, depth of discharge (DOD), and upper\ncut-off voltage (UCV) on the lifetime of NMC811/Artificial\nGraphite (AG) cells. [11] We found that cells operating at top of\ncharge with a small DOD (i.e., spend more time at high SOCs)\nexperienced more capacity loss than cells operating with a large\nDOD. This was attributed to potential oxygen release/lattice volume\ncollapse at high SOCs that will be occurring more frequently for\ncells cycling in 3.9\u20134.20 V window, for example. [11] While C-rate and\nDOD choice did impact capacity loss, cycling NMC811 past 4.06 V\nwas far more detrimental than any other factor. [11] If NMC811 cells\nare limited to 4.06 V UCV, the resistance growth is minimal and\ncapacity loss is largely governed by SEI growth only. Therefore, we\nexplored the impact of negative electrode materials on the lifetime of\nNMC811 cells and found a more competitive artificial graphite (AG)\nmaterial that outperformed our commonly-used Kaijin AML400\nmaterial.

Figure 3 shows the discharge capacity (mAh),\nnormalized capacity, and normalized \u0394V vs cycle number for\nNMC811/AGC cells with different UCVs. Despite the small\ndifference of 60 mV between the 4.04 and 4.10 V cells, the 4.04 V\ncell lost 10 % capacity and its resistance increased by 5% at 70 \u00b0C\nafter 400 cycles, compared to 15 % capacity loss and 30% resistance\ngrowth at 4.10 V UCV. Similar trends can be seen after 2500 cycles\nat 40 \u00b0C, where increasing the UCV resulted in more fade and \u0394V\ngrowth. The importance of limiting the UCV is not just to improve\ncapacity retention, but also to keep the resistance growth under\ncontrol to avoid compromising the power capabilities of the cells.

Figure 5 shows the extracted A parameter vs UCV for the 40 \u00b0C\nand 70 \u00b0C cells. Note the difference in y-axis scale for the 40 \u00b0C and\n70 \u00b0C data, At 40 \u00b0C, the A term increases slightly from 4.04 V to\n4.06 V. There is a clear increase in SEI growth at 4.08 V and 4.10 V,\nconsistent with the differences in capacity fade and \u0394V in Fig. 3.\nWhen the cell is cycled to 4.20 V UCV, the rate of SEI growth\nincreases by nearly two-fold. Similarly for 70 \u00b0C, the rate of SEI\ngrowth linearly increases from 4.04 V to 4.08 V and spikes at\n4.10 V. At 4.10 V, the A term is nearly 30 % greater than 4.08 V\ndespite only 20 mV difference in voltage. Lowering the UCV is\ntherefore critical for the longevity of NMC811 cells.\nFinally, we wanted to consider the lifetime energy output as a\nfunction of temperature and UCV. Figure 6 shows the discharge\nenergy (mWh) vs time (hours) for the cells in Fig. 3, and the total\nenergy and normalized energy outputs at 70 \u00b0C and 40 \u00b0C. Using the\nsquare-root time model to fit the measured data (see Eq. 1), we\nextrapolated the discharge energy trajectory for the different UCVs\nup until reaching 80 % of the initial discharge energy (taken as end\nof life here). From there, assuming that one C/3:C/3 cycle is\ncompleted every 6 h, we took the sum of discharge energy output\nfrom each cycle to get the cumulative energy output over the cell\u2019s\nlifetime. The total energy was then divided by the initial discharge",

The results in Fig. 6\nassume that Li loss will continue to follow the square-root time\nmodel until end of life and does not consider any failures mitigated\nby the cell form factor and/or mechanical degradation of the cell\ncomponents. Note from Fig. 4 above that the residuals from the\nsquare-root time model for the 4.20 V cells were larger than the\nlower voltage ones. In Fig. 6b, the discharge energy data for the\n4.20 V cells shows a slightly more linear trajectory than the fitted\ndata in the solid lines. This is due to the resistance growth\nexperienced at higher UCV which impacts the quality of the fit.\nThis means that estimates of cumulative stored energy for the 4.2 V\ncells tested at 40 \u00b0C will be overestimates based on only the square\nroot time model.\nFigures 6a\u20136b show that, at 70 \u00b0C and 40 \u00b0C, the time it takes the\ncell to reach 80 % of the initial discharge energy decreases as the\nUCV increases (see solid lines). Looking at Figs. 6c\u20136d, the\ncumulative energy output at end of life decreases with increasing\nUCV at both temperatures, with a sharp drop in output going from\n4.10 V to 4.20 V in Fig. 6d. The energy output for the 4.04 V cells in\nFig. 6d was nearly three times that of the 4.20 V cells, despite the\ninitial energy penalty seen in Fig. 6b.

All cycling was done at C/3:C/3 and the lower\ncut-off voltage was 3.0 V for all cells. The 40 \u00b0C cells had about 2500 cycles (1500 for 4.20 V UCV) and the 70 \u00b0C cells had about 400 cycles. The dashed line\nshows the point where \u0394V growth is at 20%. Figure 7 shows normalized \u0394V vs cumulative discharge energy\noutput (Wh) at 70 \u00b0C and 40 \u00b0C. The dashed line represents a\nhypothetical scenario where only 20 % resistance growth is allowed\nfor a given application. Here, we can clearly see that as we increase the\nUCV, the 20 % resistance growth threshold (or any other limit on \u0394V\ngrowth) will be reached at smaller energy outputs at both temperatures.\nAt 70 \u00b0C, \u0394V steadily increases with UCV. However, at 40 \u00b0C,\nthe \u0394V growth is similar for both 4.04 and 4.06 V cells at the time of\nwriting. The trends at 40 \u00b0C are likely to be the same as 70 \u00b0C but\nafter more cycling as seen in Figs. 6c-6d. The results in Figs. 6\u20137\nsuggest that limiting the UCV for NMC811 cells can be very costeffective when considering the initial cost of the cell and its lifetime\nenergy output, rather than initial $/kWh. While this usage scheme may\nnot be suitable for applications where high-energy is more important\nthan lifetime, we believe purpose-built NMC811 (or Ni-rich cells,\nmore broadly) that are balanced to operate at low UCVs can be\nimportant in stationary energy storage applications and in applications\nwhere cells are continuously exposed to high temperatures.

      "text": "Conclusions This short communication shares some long-term cycling results\non NMC811, NMC532, and NMC640 cells cycled at different DODs\nand C-rates for 12000 h at 40 \u00b0C. All cells had similar construction\nwith an identical AG negative electrode and electrolyte. In this work,\nwe showed that NMC811 cells suffer from a severe resistance growth\nwhen cycled past 4.06 V due to the large lattice volume collapse that\nthe positive electrode material experiences. This is further demonstrated in Fig. 3, where increasing the UCV by even 10\u201330 mV\nresulted in a dramatic increase in capacity loss and resistance growth\nat 40 and 70 \u00b0C. In contrast to the other NMC grades with lower Ni\ncontent, 4.3 V cycling resulted in doubling the cell\u2019s resistance (at the\nmost) for NMC532 and NMC640 compared to 4.10 V. However,\nNMC811 cells cycled to 4.20 V experienced 5-10 times the resistance\ngrowth that was seen in the same cells cycled to 4.06 V. We believe\nthis highlights an ongoing challenge with Ni-rich materials that will\ngreatly impact the cell lifetime and power capabilities. Therefore,\nlimiting the UCV when possible is a simple and important measure\nfor battery consumers to consider when operating Ni-rich cells.\nAdditionally, Ni-rich cells that are balanced to 4.04 or 4.06 V will\nrecover energy density compared to Ni-rich cells that are balanced to\n4.2 V and operated to 4.04 or 4.06 V.
