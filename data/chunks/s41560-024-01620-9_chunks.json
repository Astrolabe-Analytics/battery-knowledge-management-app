However, standardized methods for quantifying\ncapacity fade during field operation are lacking, and therefore the European\nbatteries regulation demands the development of reliable and transparent\nstate of health estimations. Here we present real-world data from 21\nprivately operated lithium-ion systems in Germany, based on up to 8 years\nof high-resolution field measurements. We develop a scalable capacity\nestimation method based on the operational data and validate it through\nregular field capacity tests. The results show that systems lose about two\nto three percentage points of usable capacity per year on average. Our\ncontribution includes the publication of an impactful dataset comprising\napproximately 106 system years, 14 billion data points and 146 gigabytes,\naiming to address the shortage of public datasets in this field. The market for home storage systems has been growing strongly over\nthe past years [1] . To make the investment of around 10,000 \u20ac per system [1]\nmore appealing, manufacturers give warranty periods of 10 years. However, the industry lacks standardized state of health (SOH) evaluations [2],\nand customers have to rely on the given values of battery management\nsystems (BMSs), which have unknown calculation schemes [2] and inaccuracies [3] . To establish transparency, the batteries regulation of the\nEuropean Union requires reliable and transparent SOH estimations [4] .\nTherefore, methods to determine the SOH of battery storage systems\nin field operation are urgently needed.\nIn the laboratory, methods to determine the SOH are defined\nto a large extent. Laboratory measurements are based on monitoring individual cells in a controlled environment, which are aged",

Operational data analysis is a promising way to overcome the\nshortcomings of conducted field capacity tests [30][\u2013][38] . The capacity-based\nSOH estimation is widely used to track the decreasing capacity [39] . Coulomb counting is an established approach for this but comes with\nseveral challenges, such as the required knowledge of an initial state\nof charge (SOC) and its sensitivity to error accumulation [40] . Therefore,\ndifferent methods have been developed to estimate the SOH, which\ncan be categorized into model-based and data-driven approaches [41] .\nModel-based methods [42] use either equivalent circuit models [40][,][43][\u2013][46]\nor electrochemical models describing the internal electrochemical\nprocesses of the battery [47][\u2013][50] . Model-based SOH estimators are mainly\nlimited by their high computational costs, and their accuracy depends\nhighly on the parameterization [39] . Machine learning methods do not\nmodel the internal working principles of the battery [51] . Instead, they\nmap ageing-related input features of the battery to its SOH [42][,][51], using\nalgorithms such as Gaussian process regression [52][,][53], support vector\nmachines [54][,][55] and different types of neural network approach [39][,][56][\u2013][58] .\nThe lack of publicly available field measurement datasets is a\nproblem that many studies face or explicitly identify as a general\nshortcoming today [2][,][59][,][60] . For example, thematical close publications\nof Dubarry et al. [60][,][61] analyse synthetical home storage system (HSS)\nbattery data derived from measured irradiance to develop diagnostic\nmethods using machine learning and incremental capacity analysis.\nThe developed methods show promising results and could be validated\nwith the dataset of this paper. Several battery datasets are accessible\nto the public, originating from laboratory measurements or synthetic\ncell simulations. Constant cycling data for varying battery chemistries\nand conditions can be found in refs. 11\u201314,62\u201366. Specific discharging\nconditions are used in refs. 67\u201371, where driving cycles are used to\nsimulate the usage of the tested batteries in EV applications. Synthetic\ndatasets simulating many degradation paths and corresponding battery data can be found in refs. 72,73. Real-world EV operational data\nwith lithium-ion batteries was recently published [2][,][74] with valuable\ndatasets [71][,][75] . Lead-acid solar home batteries in Africa are evaluated\nin ref. 76. Nevertheless, if such large field datasets are published in\nrare cases, there are usually no reference measurements to validate\nthe developed algorithms. A detailed overview of public datasets is\ngiven in ref. 59.\nOn the basis of the conducted literature research, we conclude\nthat first, most research focuses on EVs [2][,][74][,][77][\u2013][83] and not on stationary\nstorage systems [3][,][60][,][76] . Second, the measurement periods are usually\nlimited to 1\u20132 years of operation [2][,][74][,][78][\u2013][81][,][83], mostly without conducted",

However, the\ncapacity is the most important metric for the battery lifetime and is\nsubject to given warranties.\nTo contribute to battery research, this paper analyses field data\nof 21 privately operated HSSs of the first product generation over\nup to 8 years. The main scientific contributions of this paper are the\ndevelopment of a method to estimate the usable battery capacity of\nhome storage systems and the publication of the large dataset. The\nkey findings are that the measured HSSs in field operation lose about\n2\u20133 percentage points (pp) of capacity per year.

All these HSSs are\ncombined with residential PV systems to increase self-consumption.\nThe measured quantities relevant to this paper are system-level\nbattery current, voltage, power, battery pack housing temperature\nand room temperature, while the sample rate is 1 second. Table 1\ncontains an overview of the measured HSS batteries and their main\nparameters, and Supplementary Note 1 gives detailed information on\nthe measurements in general and the high-resolution measurement\nsystems used.\nThe operational behaviour of the systems is determined by two\nmain parameters, which are the system design and the used cell chemistry. While some metrics such as the current rate (C-rate) or the number\nof equivalent full cycles (EFCs) depend on the system design and the\nratio of battery energy to inverter power, the cell chemistries have\ndifferent open circuit voltage (OCV) curves and specific ageing characteristics. Supplementary Tables 1 and 2 give more information on\nthe system-specific quantities and the used measurement hardware.\nFigure 1a shows the C-rate and the cell voltage for an exemplary HSS and\nsummer day, while Fig. 1b,c presents an overview of data availability and\ndata gaps, which is explained in more detail in Supplementary Note 2.\nThe different cathode materials are lithium nickel manganese\ncobalt oxide (NMC), a blend of lithium manganese oxide (LMO) and\nNMC (simply referred to as \u2018LMO\u2019 in this paper), and lithium iron phosphate (LFP). Within the NMC systems, there are differences in cell\nchemistry. Two of the NMC systems have a high nickel share.\nTo account for system design and cell chemistry, the system\nnomenclature gives information on both parameters to interpret the\nresults. Therefore, this paper refers to \u2018SmallLMO\u2019 (or \u2018SLMO\u2019), \u2018MediumNMC\u2019\n(or \u2018MNMC\u2019) and \u2018MediumLFP\u2019 (or \u2018MLFP\u2019) HSSs. As there are already HSSs\nin the energy range above 15 kWh on the market, none of the systems\nare classified as large. SLMO and MNMC systems share similar battery\nchemistries, but their system design is not comparable. While the\nMLFP and the MNMC systems show a similar system design, their battery\nchemistries are not comparable.\nThe 1,270 monthly CSV files can be downloaded from a public\nrepository [84] [(https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12091223).](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12091223)",

Their\nend of discharge (EOD) voltage shows two peaks, as the BMS decreases\nit over the lifetime to compensate for ageing. The distribution of the\nMNMC systems shows three peaks each, representing the different EOD\nand EOC voltages of specific systems with different NMC types and BMS\nsettings. The MLFP distribution does not show the characteristic EOD\nand EOD peaks owing to the flat OCV of LFP.\nThe C-rate distributions in Fig. 1e indicate that systems are charged\nat higher C-rates (positive values) than discharged (negative values).\nCharging often occurs at higher C-rates owing to the relatively high\nPV power compared with the battery inverter. By contrast, discharge\noccurs largely during the night, in which household standby consumption is also met with a few hundred watts, resulting in low discharge\nrates.

The\nSOHC values depend on the specific HSS within a system type. Especially\nfor the older SLMO systems, varying SOHC results can be observed at a\nsimilar age. In addition, the ageing behaviour differs among the system\ntypes. The SLMO systems do not show lower SOHC values compared with\nthe MNMC systems despite more EFCs at a comparable age.\nSupplementary Note 6 provides all the necessary information to\nunderstand the conducted capacity tests and warranty conditions.\nSupplementary Fig. 6 explains the capacity reserves that manufacturers apply to meet warranty conditions. The reserves are implemented\nby stating less capacity on the datasheet than the HSSs have. Supplementary Fig. 7 shows the capacity test scheme, and Supplementary\nFig. 8 shows the influence of the ageing reserve and the normalization\nquantity on the warranty condition. **Capacity estimation based on operational data**\nHSSs regularly reach EOC and EOD voltage, and full cycles occur.\nThe developed method uses this behaviour to estimate the capacity\n(Methods and Supplementary Methods). First, it identifies relaxation\nphases around the EOC and EOD voltages. Second, it estimates the\nrelaxation OCV using a second-order equivalent circuit model with a\ntwo-step fitting procedure. Third, it estimates the capacity using an\noffset-current-corrected coulomb counting between a fully charged\n(EOC voltage) and a fully discharged (EOD voltage) state.\nFigure 3 shows the storage operation of two exemplary days. During this period, the HSS shows a full cycle: It is empty at the beginning\nof day 1, gets fully charged until noon, stays at a high SOC during the\nday and is fully discharged overnight. The next day, it gets fully charged\nagain. On the basis of this storage operation, four integration possibilities exist to estimate the capacity while integrating the current [Nature Energy | Volume 9 | November](http://www.nature.com/natureenergy) 2024 | 1438\u20131447 **1441**",

The trend is a linear fit of the from empty-to-empty (E2E), full-to-full (F2F), empty-to-full (E2F) and\nfull-to-empty (F2E).\nWhen integrating full cycles in the form of E2E and F2F operations,\nit becomes apparent that the integrated current is not exactly equal to\nzero.

A linear fit is in line with some\nobservations in literature [86], although both linear and nonlinear ageing\nbehaviour are possible [87] . However, the so-called knee point [88][,][89] cannot\nyet be observed clearly for the systems. While the field capacity tests\nof the SLMO and the MNMC systems vary around the ageing trend, the\ncapacity test values of the MLFP systems are always at the lower end of\nthe estimates and below the trend. The reason for this is that the system\ndoes not reduce the current towards the EOD voltage. This results in",

Concerning 100 EFCs, the ageing\nrates are 1.2 pp per 100 EFCs for SLMO, 0.9 pp per 100 EFCs for MNMC and\n0.7 pp per 100 EFCs for MLFP. The high SOHC decrease of SLMO systems\ncan possibly be explained by their higher number of EFCs, higher DODs\nand higher C-rates compared with the medium systems. However, for\nthe yearly values, a range of approximately 2 pp a [\u22121] can be observed for\nall system types, showing differences in ageing behaviour between\nsimilar HSSs. Purely from the gradients, the physical EOL can be estimated after 5 years (for 4 pp a [\u22121] ) and after 20 years (for 1 pp a [\u22121] ). While\nthe shorter durations can already be confirmed for some HSSs, linear\nextrapolation is not reasonable for the HSSs with low ageing rates based\non the nonlinear ageing towards the EOL.\nThe SLMO systems show the lowest mean capacity confidence width\nwith a value of 4.4 pp, followed by the MNMC systems with 6.8 pp and\nthe MLFP systems with 8.0 pp. The reason for the high accuracy of SLMO\nsystems can be explained by their high cycle number and an accurate\nidentification of EOC and EOD voltage owing to the LMO OCV curve.\nThe MNMC systems with NMC cells share this voltage characteristic but\nshow fewer full cycles, leading to fewer estimates and, consequently,\nwider confidence ranges. In addition, a higher connection of cells in\nparallel leads to higher inaccuracy in OCV estimation for some systems\nwhile others can be estimated with higher accuracy. LFP has a substantially flatter OCV curve than LMO and NMC, leading to less accurate EOC\nand EOD detection. Combined with a medium number of full cycles,\ntheir average usable capacity and energy estimates are worse, although\nsome systems reach comparably good CI values below 5%.\nThe results for the usable energy decrease look similar to the\ncapacity analysis, leading to the conclusion that the loss of capacity is\nthe dominant ageing effect. A possible increase in internal resistance\nappears secondary. Otherwise, the decrease in energy-related state of\nhealth (SOHE) would be significantly higher owing to resistance losses.\nAn offset-corrected coulomb counting is described as an established\nmethod in literature with known shortcomings of error accumulation and\nunknown start SOC. In addition, manufacturers have already applied the\nmethod. However, we think that the following arguments highlight the\nimportance of the presented method, which is tailored to HSS operation. First, the regular and timely close reach of EOD and EOC voltage",

This focus on regularly occurring full cycles is\nnot possible for many other applications such as EVs (which typically\ndo not get fully discharged) or battery storage systems for frequency\nrestoration (which have a mean SOC of around 50%). Further, the applied\ncurrent correction makes the errors smaller. Second, the capacity estimation method does not require an initial SOC, as it starts and ends at\nfully charged or fully discharged states close to the identified EOD and\nEOC voltage.

      "text": "**Conclusion**\nThe batteries regulation of the European Union [4] requires reliable SOH\nestimation based on field data. However, so far, neither standardized\nmethods nor enough datasets exist to develop these. This paper contributes to both by analysing field measurements of 21 HSSs over a\nmeasurement period of up to 8 years. The dataset is, so far, valuable for\na scientific dataset in terms of measurement duration and sample rate.\nIt consists of 106 system years represented by 14 billion data points. Its\n146 gigabytes cover three important lithium-ion battery technologies:\nLFP, NMC and a blend of LMO and NMC.\nThe developed SOH estimation automatically detects the electrochemical processes of overvoltage relaxation at low currents and uses\ntheir characteristics for the parameter estimation of a second-order\nequivalent circuit battery model. With these parameters, the exact SOC at\nboth full charge and full discharge is calculated. These values compute the\nremaining capacity, energy and SOH while analysing current and voltage\nusing coulomb counting and current correction. The analysed storage\nsystems show average decreases in usable capacity of around two to three\npercentage points per year. From a technical perspective, single systems\nwith a higher capacity fade reach their EOL after 5\u20137 years, defined as 80%\nof their nominal capacity. Others still show reasonable SOH values after\nthe same operational period, indicating a longer lifetime. Nevertheless,\nthe given warranty periods can be reached in most cases by including\nageing reserves. Considering that the measured HSSs were from the first\nproduct generation, this is a positive sign for the industry. **Methods**\n**Battery model and relaxation phase detection**\nA battery model is needed to estimate the OCV of the battery at identified EOC and EOD relaxation phases. The used second-order battery\nmodel is inspired by literature [90][\u2013][93], and its parametrization is described\nin Supplementary Methods (Supplementary Figs. 9\u201311, with Supplementary equations (1)\u2013(5)).\nEquation (1) is used for the final fit. The parameters include the\nmeasured battery voltage _V_ bat, the open circuit voltage _V_ OCV, the voltage\n_V_ fast over the first resistor-capacitor (RC) element for the fast processes\nlike charge transfer with the time constant _\u03c4_ fast, and the voltage _V_ slow over\nthe second RC element responsible for slow diffusion effects with the\ntime constant _\u03c4_ slow. The distribution of the relaxation voltages and their\ndurations can be seen in Supplementary Fig. 12. - _t_ [+] _\u03c4_ slow _V_ bat( _t_ ) \u2212 _V_ OCV = _V_ fast \u00d7 e - _t_ [+] _\u03c4_ fast + _V_ slow \u00d7 e",
