However, the performance of\nLIBs deteriorates with time and usage, and the state of health of used batteries are difficult to\nquantify and to date are poorly understood. Having accurate estimations of a battery\u2019s remaining life\nacross different life stages would benefit maintenance, safety, and serve as a means of qualifying\nused batteries for second-life applications. Since the full history of a battery may not always be\navailable in downstream applications, in this study, we demonstrate a deep learning framework that\nenables dynamic degradation trajectory prediction, while requiring only the most recent battery\nusage information. Specifically, our model takes a rolling window of current and voltage time-series\ninputs, and predicts the near-term and long-term capacity fade via a recurrent neural network. We\nexhaustively benchmark our model against a naive extrapolating model by evaluating the error on\nreconstructing the discharge capacity profile under different settings. We show that our model\u2019s\nperformance in accurately inferring the battery\u2019s degradation profile is _agnostic_ with respect to cell\ncycling history and its current state of health. This approach can provide a promising path towards\nevaluating battery health in running vehicles, enhance edge-computing battery diagnostics, and\ndetermine the state of health for used batteries with unknown cycling histories. **1** **Introduction**",

      "text": "**1** **Introduction** Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are an enabling technology for clean energy innovation and zero-emissions transportation,\nwhich will play a critical role in reducing pollution and mitigating climate change. However, a key limitation is that the\ncapacity of LIBs \u2013 the amount of charge a battery can reversibly hold in one discharge or usage cycle \u2013 deteriorates\nnonlinearly with time and usage and so LIBs must eventually be replaced. This reality makes awareness of a battery\u2019s\nstate of health (SOH) an important part of practical large-scale deployment of batteries in consumer, engineering, and\nindustrial settings. Tools to monitor battery health and forecast future battery performance will be important for critical\napplications like grid-level energy storage systems [1], electric vehicles (EV) [2\u20134], aerospace [5], and solar power\ngeneration [6]. These applications may involve deployment in contexts with low computational resources, or where the\nfull history of the battery is not available, introducing new practical design constraints for prognostic tools. Therefore,\na computationally efficient model which can make useful predictions about battery degradation while using limited\ninformation about the cell in question would be highly desirable. In this work, we present a model architecture and\nlabel design built to satisfy these criteria that can predict the imminent degradation of the battery with minimal prior\nknowledge of the cell required. The task of forecasting battery degradation with limited historical data is challenging by the fact that the LIB degradation\nprocess is highly path dependent, with various nonlinear and intersecting failure modes across time-scales, environmental\nconditions, use-cases, cell designs, and battery chemistries [7, 8]. This complexity makes it difficult to decompose aging\nmechanisms into a coherent physico-chemical model that can accurately predict and explain degradation.

Moreover, early\nand frequent inferences on life cycle statistics can facilitate timely LIB research by allowing researchers to accelerate\nperformance testing in response to cell design or process parameters, validating a particular configuration without\nhaving to go through exhaustive time-consuming and resource-intensive cycling measurements [12, 13].

      "text": "Our work relies on a simple heuristic about the total observed degradation of discharge capacity: that the degradation of\na fresh battery typically occurs in three regimes. First, a slow, linear decay in discharge capacity at the early life-cycle,\nsecond, accelerated nonlinear decay (a.k.a _knee point roll-over_ ) [50], and finally, fast linear decay. Thus, the knee point\ncan also be identified using predictions about coarse changes in the curvature of the discharge capacity. The main\ncontributions in this work address two limitations from the data-driven modeling and practical battery management\npoints of view. 1) Our approach does not require having access to the full cycling history of the cell. This can be of\nimportance in real-world applications, where the prior knowledge on the battery\u2019s life cycle is primarily limited to the\nmost recent cycling data. More importantly, this advantage can provide a promising path towards a robust estimation of\nend-of-life (EOL) of used batteries with limited available cycling history, as well as suggesting second-life applications,\ngiven cells\u2019 inferred health status. 2) We demonstrate a feature-free deep learning model using an architecture that\ncombines recurrent neural networks (Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory), and convolutional neural networks. Our\nmodel uses windows of raw current and voltage time-series data as input and yields outputs of two scalars describing\nnear- and long-term capacity loss. This can be critical in edge-computing battery diagnostics, where non-engineered\nfeatures directly coming from the battery management system can be used for vehicle on-board inference. This can\nsimply make the trained inference models computationally more tractable, and promote EOL estimations for operating\ncells in a running vehicle. It is also important to note that obtaining and engineering the most informative set of\nnon-correlated features and is an important but challenging goal in real-world battery diagnostics applications that is the\nfocus of ongoing research [7]. This manuscript is organized as follows. In Section 2, we start by describing the battery cycling dataset, and deep\nlearning model architecture, as well as the choices for the model hyperparameters. This is followed in Section 3 by\nshowing results on reconstructing the discharge capacity profile and evaluating the model performance in a comparative\nsetting with a naive extrapolating model under different scenarios.

We refer to the predicted linearized dropoff\ninterchangably via variables called _m_ or _slopes_, borrowed from the familiar form of _y_ = _mx_ + _b_ from elementary\nlinear fit. Note that rather than making predictions of the actual values of discharge capacities in the following output\nwindow of cycles, our model predicts the linearized magnitude of drop in the cell\u2019s discharge capacity; in other words,\nfor the linearized near-future of the battery, our model predicts a slope _m_ but not the offset _b_ . The dropoffs in capacity\nthat we use as our output labels are measured by two slopes of two linear fits to the discharge capacity curve between\nthe end of the last cycle in the input window and the mid-point of the prediction window, denoted as slope _m_ 1, and\nfrom the mid-point to the final cycle of the following prediction window, denoted as slope _m_ 2.

The motivation for this choice is that rather than explicitly predicting the falloff with full accuracy, we instead\nreduce the task to determining the onset of nonlinearity\u2013 which can be approximated by the difference between the two\nslopes.

In summary, across the output window _m_ 1 and _m_ 2 respectively account for the short-term and long-term drop in the\ndischarge capacity. In a healthy pre-knee cell, where discharge capacity drops linearly as a function of cycles, the\nabsolute values for _m_ 1 and _m_ 2 are approximately equal ( _|m_ 2 _| \u2248|m_ 1 _|_ ) and individually small in magnitude.

      "text": "It is important to note that we neglect the data from the first 2% of discharge capacity drop (compared to the nominal\ncapacity), when defining the prediction window size, which would cause the overall performance of the naive model\n(and likely the RNN model) to be overestimated. The rationale behind this is to avoid including the earliest part of\nthe battery\u2019s first linear capacity drop region, where _|m_ 2 _\u2212_ _m_ 1 _| \u2248_ 0 (this is equivalent to the very first few snippets\nin Figure 4), and focus more on the prediction windows at and beyond the knee point roll-over, where the expected\nmagnitude of error is significantly larger. For the sake of comparison, a similar analysis was done by removing this\nminimum cut-off and having no restrictions on where the prediction window is throughout the entire battery cycling\nhistory (see Figure S3 in the Supporting Information). Regardless of the input and prediction window size, our RNN\nmodel outperforms the naive extrapolating model, by having a much lower RMSE in reconstructing the discharge\ncapacity profile (Figure 5a). In fact, the maximum observed RMSE from the RNN model ( _\u2248_ 0 _._ 0171, marked as point A\nin Figure 5) is less than half of the maximum RMSE using the naive model. More importantly, as observed in Figure 5c,\nwith the increase of the input window size while setting the prediction window size fixed, the RMSE from the RNN\nmodel decreases, whereas we see the opposite trend in the naive model (Figure 5b). The reason for this trend can be\nattributed to the fact that a larger input window for a linear fit increases the influence of the earlier values of the curve\n(where the curve is virtually always flatter), especially in the vicinity of knee-point (where the nonlinearity is at a global 7",

It is important to note that our RNN model can learn this nonlinear behavior with the increase of the input\nwindow size, especially at larger prediction sizes (100-200), where the RMSE is lower.

      "text": "**3.3** **History-agnostic Inference at Varying State of Health** Finally, we benchmark our model for degradation prediction at different states of health. This is done by evaluating\nthe capacity reconstruction RMSE for each prediction window, as a function of the absolute difference between the\npredicted slopes (i.e. _|m_ 2 _\u2212_ _m_ 1 _|_ ), as represented in Figure 6. The newly defined _|m_ 2 _\u2212_ _m_ 1 _|_ prediction determines the\nlevel of nonlinearity of the capacity fade within the prediction window, and is mostly equal to zero. This is expected\nsince most of the cell\u2019s cycling history occurs during a period of linear capacity fade, which is either slow linear decay\nbefore the knee, or rapid linear decay beyond the knee point. Every column in Figure 6, has RMSE results for small,\nmedium, and large prediction window sizes (i.e. 10, 100, 200, respectively). Similarly, rows are sorted based on\nsmall, medium, and large input window sizes (i.e. 10, 50, 100, respectively). Each point is color coded based on the\nnormalized value of the maximum _|m_ 2 _\u2212_ _m_ 1 _|_ observed within the history of cycles in each test cell normalized by the\nglobal maximum _|m_ 2 _\u2212_ _m_ 1 _|_ for a particular cell ( _Mobserved/Mmax_ ). This allows us to have a better assessment of the\nmodel performance at the regions specifically close to the knee point roll-over, where the _Mobserved/Mmax_ reaches\n1 _._ 0. This region is represented by points marked with red color. The blue points ( _Mobserved/Mmax \u2248_ 0) correspond to\nthe linear capacity fade at the early cycles of the cells. Colors in-between account for transition region between linear\nand nonlinear domains of the discharge capacity profile. Considering the first column in Figure 6, the RMSE for small\nprediction windows are by an order of magnitude smaller than medium and large ones, regardless of the choice for\ninput window size. Surprisingly, for prediction window size of 10, the magnitude of this error is _agnostic_ to the current\nstate state of health of the tested battery, as the majority of points with red and blue colors are colocated at the very low\nRMSE. Note that we use a simple method of double linear fits via _m_ 1 and _m_ 2 to reconstruct the capacity fade profile.\nConsequently, for larger prediction window sizes (i.e. 100 and 200), and where the knee point roll-over falls within the\nprediction window (red points), it is expected that RMSE grows. It is naturally expected that deploying more linear fits\nwithin the prediction window can help reduce RMSE at larger prediction windows, especially at the vicinity of the knee\npoint roll-over. It is important to note that the top right panel in Figure 6 exactly corresponds to the point _A_ in Figure 5a,\nwhere we have pushed our RNN model to its lowest-performing regime.

It is also important to note that the computational resource-intensive model training step is completed\non high-performance or cloud computers, whereas the inference model, which is typically cheap to evaluate, can be\nloaded into the battery management system. 2) In the latter setting, our approach can be applied to real-world used\nbattery second-life application assessments, where typically a cell\u2019s entire cycling history is unknown. By only using\na limited recent cycling history, the used battery can be qualified for different small-scale applications in stationary\nenergy storage systems that typically require less-frequent battery cycling (i.e. 100 to 300 cycles per year). This can\nhelp battery manufacturers and recyclers develop more established plans for used batteries, and thus, prevent the current\nmass disposal strategy of LIBs that poses many environmental and financial concerns. **4** **Conclusions** Data-driven modeling is a promising route for battery diagnostics and early end-of-life estimations by bypassing the\nrequirement for time-consuming and resource-intensive battery life cycle testing. In this work, we develop a deep\nlearning model that is capable of dynamically predicting short and long-term discharge capacity fade in commercial\ngraphite/LiFePO4 batteries[47] cycled under fast-charging conditions. Our model takes as input time-series voltage and\ncurrent data from an arbitrary window of cycles, and reconstructs the discharge capacity fade for the following window\nof cycles, _without_ the need for access to the full cycling history of the battery. This approach can complement battery\nmanagement systems by allowing for an on-board resource-efficient inference of the end-of-life for operating cells,\nidentify abnormal cell behaviors, and even warn for the time that the battery requires replacement. More importantly,\nthis approach can provide a promising path towards estimating end-of-life of used batteries, where there are typically\nlimited cycling history available, and suggest second-life applications given the cells\u2019 state of health. **Conflict of Interest Statement** The authors are _in the process of filing_ a patent on the work described in this paper. **Acknowledgements** S.S. acknowledges Xiao Cui, Patrick Asinger from the Data-Driven Design of Li-ion Batteries (D3BATT) program and\nJens Hummelsh\u00f8j from the E&M Division at Toyota Research Institute for fruitful discussions. **Data Availability** [The datasets used in this study are available at https://data.matr.io/1.
