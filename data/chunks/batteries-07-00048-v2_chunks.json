This technology does not only fulfill the requirements of electric mobility, but\nis also found in most portable electric devices. Even though Li-ion batteries are known for their\nnumerous advantages, they undergo serious performance degradation during their aging, and more\nparticularly when used in specific conditions such as at low temperature or high charging current\nrates. Depending on the operational conditions, different aging mechanisms are favored and can\ninduce physical and chemical modifications of the internal components, leading to performance\ndecay. In this article, the identification of the degradation mechanisms was carried out thanks to an\nin-depth ante- and post mortem study on three high power and high energy commercial 18,650 cells.\nLi-ion cells were aged using a battery electric vehicle (BEV) aging profile at _\u2212_ 20 _[\u25e6]_ C, 0 _[\u25e6]_ C, 25 _[\u25e6]_ C, and\n45 _[\u25e6]_ C in accordance with the international standard IEC 62-660, and in calendar aging mode at 45 _[\u25e6]_ C\nand SOC 100%. Internal components recovered from fresh and aged cells were investigated through\ndifferent electrochemical (half-coin cell), chemical (EDX, GD-OES, NMR), and topological (SEM)\ncharacterization techniques. The influence of power and energy cells\u2019 internal design and Si content\nin the negative electrode on cell aging has been highlighted vis-\u00e0-vis the capacity and power fade. **Keywords:** Li-ion; battery; aging; degradation mechanisms; post mortem analysis **1. Introduction** Li-ion batteries with graphite-based negative electrodes are today largely widespread\nin electric mobility applications due to their higher energy density and durability than\nother storage systems. Currently the main developments in Li-ion batteries concerns the\nincrease of their power density and lifetime by introducing new positive electrode materials\nor adding silicon in the negative electrode. Lifetime is more particularly studied because\ncertain environmental and operational conditions favor some degradation mechanisms\ninside the cell that can accelerate the capacity fade [1,2]. Indeed, depending on the cycling\nand storage conditions, different aging mechanisms can be activated and degrade the\nelectrode components (loss of active materials) or their interfaces (loss of cyclable lithium). _Batteries_ **2021**, _7_ [, 48. https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries7030048](https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries7030048) [https://www.mdpi.com/journal/batteries](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/batteries)",

The choice of the same\nmanufacturer was made to ensure that the mechanical design, the separator and the\nelectrolyte composition of the three cell references are similar. To access these internal\ncharacteristics, all three reference cells were analyzed. The obtained design characteristics\nare detailed in the ante mortem section.\nThe cells were aged using a BEV (battery electric vehicle) representative cycling test\naccording to the international standard IEC 62-660 at various temperatures ( _\u2212_ 20 _[\u25e6]_ C, 0 _[\u25e6]_ C,\n25 _[\u25e6]_ C, 45 _[\u25e6]_ C). The calendar aging was carried out at 45 _[\u25e6]_ C, either at constant voltage (CV)\nat 4.2 V, or at 100% SOC in open circuit voltage (OCV, meaning that the voltage is not\nmaintained constantly). The voltage difference between CV and OCV calendar aging is\nbetween 0.02 V and 0.1 V maximum after 6 weeks aging. The cycling is representative\nof a typical driving cycle including a CC-CV charge and a discharge profile with current\npulses that simulate acceleration (discharge) and braking (charge) phases. As described in\nthe standard IEC 62-660, the cycling test is stopped once the cell has lost at least 20% of\nits initial performance in terms of capacity, energy or power density, or after 6 months of\ncycling. The storage test is stopped in calendar conditions after 18 weeks. State of health\nassessment via electrical performance measurements were realized at 25 _[\u25e6]_ C every 28 days\nof cycling and every 6 weeks for calendar aging. Such electrical measurements allow\ntracking of the evolution of some relevant cell characteristics: capacity, internal resistance,\nand nominal voltage.

The nature of separator\n(AlOOH coated PE film) was the same for the three cell references. Some more significant\ndifferences were noted concerning the negative electrode that was composed of graphite\nwith silicon oxide content of 4.5%wt for 30Q cell, pure graphite for 32E cell, and graphite\nwith silicon oxide content of 1.5%wt for 35E cell. The electrolyte composition, analyzed\nby GC-MS, was not exactly the same but two main solvents (EC:DMC) were common to\nthe three cells. FEC was present when silicon oxide was present at the negative electrode\n(30Q and 35E). All of them contained succinonitrile in low quantities. This is an additive\nknown to improve the thermal stability and broaden the oxidation electrochemical window\nof electrolyte [35]. A low amount of methyl propionate as an additive to improve the\nlow temperature performance [36] was detected only in the 32E cell. The cell design was\nvery different for the three references. The 30Q cell had the thinnest and therefore the\nlongest electrodes compared to 35E and 32E cells, which gave it a power design with the\nability to accept high currents. On the other hand, 35E and 32E cells had an energy design\nas the electrodes were thicker and consequently shorter in length. Such a power design\nwas obtained because the thickness of the negative electrode could be reduced by the\npresence of a silicon compound whose high specific capacity made it possible to obtain\na high surface capacity. In the case of the 35E cell, the lower quantity of silicon in the\nnegative electrode led to an increase in its surface capacity, a decrease in its thickness, and\nconsequently allowed association of it to a more loaded positive electrode. Such design is\nrepresentative of an energy design more advanced than the 32E design where the negative\nelectrode is pure graphite and consequently thicker that the 35E negative electrode. _3.2.

It is noteworthy that each mark on the curves is\nthe average value of the parameter considered measured on 15 cells for each temperature\ncondition. The standard deviation is indicated by an error bar and reached a maximum\nvalue of _\u00b1_ 3.3% for 35E cell values at _\u2212_ 20 _[\u25e6]_ C, but is mostly less than _\u00b1_ 1%.\nThe behavior in cycling is given in Figure 1 (left curves). Cycling at very low temperature ( _\u2212_ 20 _[\u25e6]_ C) is very harmful. At high temperature cycling (45 _[\u25e6]_ C) the cell performance\ndecreases quite quickly: the effective capacity decreases by about 20% after 300 equivalent\ncycles for cell 30Q. When cycling at 0 _[\u25e6]_ C and 25 _[\u25e6]_ C, the evolution of 30Q cell capacity\nis less pronounced: capacity fading is approximately 10% at 0 _[\u25e6]_ C and 15% at 25 _[\u25e6]_ C after 300 equivalent cycles. All those results are in agreement with the manufacturer data\nsheets [37] which specify a lifetime equal to 250 cycles with charging conditions between\n0 _[\u25e6]_ C and 50 _[\u25e6]_ C. After 18 weeks of calendar aging at 45 _[\u25e6]_ C (Figure 1, right curves) and for\nthe three cell references, the loss of capacity is approximately 10%. As expected, capacity\ndecay during calendar aging is less pronounced than for cycling aging, but not negligible.\nThe performance fading is generally slower during calendar aging than during cycling at\nthe same temperature and the same test time. Calendar aging in CV is more damaging\nthan in OCV. Considering the individual behavior of the three cell references, 32E and 35E\ncells show a quite different cycling behavior compared to the 30Q cell. They present a fast\ndecay of capacity at 0 _[\u25e6]_ C and, in contrast, very slow performance losses at 25 _[\u25e6]_ C and 45 _[\u25e6]_ C.\nThe calendar aging of 35E cell is very weak compared to the others.",

The internal resistance increases more significantly during cycling especially at high temperatures\n(25 _[\u25e6]_ C and 45 _[\u25e6]_ C).

Calendar aging is also more particularly stressful under CV condition. For example,\nthe 30Q cell internal resistance increases by 60% in OCV and by 175% in CV. In terms of the\ninternal resistance variation, 18 weeks of calendar aging at 4.2 V and 45 _[\u25e6]_ C is equivalent to\n320 cycles at the same temperature. The evolution of nominal voltage shows similarities for\nthe three references. At high temperatures (25 _[\u25e6]_ C and 45 _[\u25e6]_ C), in cycling and calendar aging,\nthe nominal voltage decreases while in cycling at low temperatures (0 _[\u25e6]_ C and _\u2212_ 20 _[\u25e6]_ C) the\nnominal voltage does not show significant changes. For example, the 30Q cell nominal\nvoltage falls down by about 0.1 V after cycling at 45 _[\u25e6]_ C and increases only about 0.01 V\nafter cycling at _\u2212_ 20 _[\u25e6]_ C.\nThe performance of the three cell references are combined in the Figure 2. Cell\nenergy losses during cycling and calendar aging are plotted in function of the operating\ntemperatures. The cell energy depends on both capacity and nominal voltage parameters.\nCycling at _\u2212_ 20 _[\u25e6]_ C induces faster energy losses of 2% per EFC (Equivalent Full Cycle) for\n32E cell than for 35E cell and also for 30Q cell that exhibit a similar loss of 0.2% per EFC. At\n0 _[\u25e6]_ C both energy cells, the 32E and the 35E, have significant losses whereas the 30Q power\ncell is not damaged. Whatever the cell reference is, cycling at 25 _[\u25e6]_ C and 45 _[\u25e6]_ C do not induce\nhuge energy losses; 0.02% per EFC and 0.08% per EFC respectively. According to Figure 2,\nwe can state that the power cell has an optimal working temperature range between 0 _[\u25e6]_ C\nand 25 _[\u25e6]_ C while the energy cell operates best between 25 _[\u25e6]_ C and 45 _[\u25e6]_ C. Energy losses\nduring calendar aging at 45 _[\u25e6]_ C are not negligible and are included between 0.03% per day\nand 0.18% per day. The constant voltage (CV) calendar aging is most degrading than the\nopen circuit voltage (OCV) calendar aging.",

This could possibly indicate the\nformation of lithium plating in sufficient quantity so that a part of it, not oxidized by\nelectrolyte, remains active in metallic form. However, in the case of anodes containing Si,\nthe GD-OES method is not capable of identifying Li depositions clearly due to formation\nof Li silicates [49].

Conclusions** Ante- and post mortem characterizations have provided essential insight to link aging\nconditions to degradation mechanisms. Thanks to these results, an identification of the\ndegradation mechanisms was performed on three commercial 18,650 cell types after aging\naccording to a BEV (battery electric vehicle) aging profile in cycling at _\u2212_ 20 _[\u25e6]_ C, 0 _[\u25e6]_ C, 25 _[\u25e6]_ C,\n45 _[\u25e6]_ C, and in calendar aging conditions at 45 _[\u25e6]_ C and SOC 100%. The complementary information obtained from electrochemical, morphological (SEM) and chemical (EDX, GD-OES,\nand NMR) characterization techniques allowed to identify the main aging mechanisms for\neach aging condition.\nThe main degradations are located at the negative electrode and are manifested by the\ngrowth of SEI, either by solvent degradation during high temperature calendar aging, or\nby the growth of SEI by salt degradation during high temperature cycling. The deposition\nof lithium metal for low temperature cycling leading to the formation of a secondary SEI\nis identified. In addition, silicon particles suffer significantly during cycling aging at low\ntemperature through particle cracking and disaggregation.\nThe internal design of the cell influences the aging mechanisms, as high energy cells\nare more exposed at low temperature to lithium metal deposition due to their thicker\nelectrodes coating which decrease the electrodes\u2019 kinetics.",
