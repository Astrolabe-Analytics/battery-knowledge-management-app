The modular design enables future enhancements including multi-view clustering and advanced SoH\nprediction models. This framework provides manufacturers a systematic approach to regulatory compliance\nwhile reducing unnecessary testing and mitigating over-engineering risk. Batteries have become indispensable in modern life, as highlighted\nby Iser and Schadwinkel [1]. They power everyday handheld devices\nsuch as smartphones, enable the integration of renewable energy into\npower grids [2], and serve as the core energy source for BEVs [3]. Recent studies by Fichtner et al. [3] and Passerini et al. [4] emphasize that\nfuture battery development must address multiple challenges, including\nimprovements in \u2018\u2018 _energy_ _density[...][,_ _R.S.]_ _fast_ _charging_ _[capabilities,_\n_R.S.][...]_ _sustainability_ _of_ _resources,_ _the_ _recyclability_ _of_ _components,_ _cycle-_\n_and_ _calendar_ _lifetime_ _of_ _the_ _system,_ _safety_ _and_ _costs_ \u2019\u2019 [3, p. 4]. These requirements are particularly critical for automotive applications, where\ndiverse usage patterns and environmental conditions influence battery\nperformance. The global demand for batteries is projected to rise significantly\nin terms of overall battery capacity, driven by the electrification of\ntransport and renewable integration. According to Passerini et al. [4]\nthe annual growth rate for batteries since 2010 is 30 % with smaller\nannual growth rates to be estimated by 2030 onward. Fichtner et al.

This growing diversity\nin battery chemistries combined with an increase in demand complicates product comparison for consumers and motivates legislators to\nestablish harmonized standards. In the automotive sector, two major regulatory frameworks are\nshaping battery lifetime requirements: the Euro 7 regulation by the European Commission [6] in the European Union and the ACCII regulation by the _California_ _Air_ _Resources_ _Board_ (CARB) [7] in the United\nStates. Both aim to ensure durability and reliability of traction batteries\nin BEVs, setting minimum thresholds for the remaining service life,\ncommonly expressed as SoH. Inside this paper, the capacity-based\ndefinition of SoH will be used, as recommended by the United Nations [8], to ensure consistency with international standards and regulatory frameworks. Furthermore, the capacity-based SoH will simply\nbe referred to as SoH throughout this paper. The ACCII regulation will apply from model year 2026, as outlined\nin the official CARB documentation [7], with detailed compliance\nrequirements specified in the technical guidelines [9]. Despite similar\nminimum SoH requirements (70 %), the regulations differ in their durability targets: Euro 7 mandates compliance after 8 years or 160 _,_ 000 km,\nwhereas ACCII requires 10 years or 240 _,_ 000 km. These thresholds will\nbe further referred to as _regulatory_ _boundaries_ . Furthermore, by 2030,\nACCII will tighten its requirement to 80 % SoH. Non-compliance can\ntrigger recalls if more than 10 % of a fleet fails to meet these limits,\nas stated in CARB\u2019s enforcement policy [10] and confirmed by international regulatory guidelines [8]. Consequently, SoH requirements are\nclosely linked to the _End_ _of_ _Warranty_ (EoW) criteria defined by manufacturers (e.g., Volkswagen AG [11] or Tesla, Inc. [12]), which often\nalign with regulatory thresholds. For instance, Volkswagen specifies an\nEoW capacity of 70 % [11]. To the best of current knowledge, existing\nregulations do not provide exemptions for specific usage patterns, such\nas frequent fast charging. However, the SoH is influenced by both the age of the battery and its\nusage patterns, which are directly linked to vehicle operation, making\ncompliance under all circumstances challenging for manufacturers.

      "text": "Previous studies have examined the relationship between usage and\nbattery aging from different perspectives. Broussely et al. [13] provided foundational insights into electrochemical degradation mechanisms,\nwhile Keil et al. [14] focused on aging differences caused by temperature and cell chemistry. In contrast, Vermeer et al. [15] offered a\ncomprehensive review of how usage parameters impact battery aging\nand interact with each other. More recently, von B\u00fclow [16] analyzed\nthe variability of aging in real-world BEV fleet conditions over full\nequivalent cycles. Many of these insights, however, were obtained\nunder controlled laboratory conditions. To mitigate the risk of recalls despite the large variety of influencing factors, batteries must undergo rigorous testing. Current testing\nprotocols typically rely on homogeneous profiles that fail to represent\nreal-world variability [17]. For example, Schreiber et al. [18] expanded\non these findings by detailing aging mechanisms occurring under standardized profiles, while Geslin et al. [19] emphasized that such profiles\nhinder accurate lifetime predictions. Furthermore, Saam et al. [20]\ndemonstrated that real-world usage profiles differ substantially across\nuser percentiles, highlighting the need for more representative testing\napproaches. Nazari et al. [21] provided an overview of conducted research using\ndifferent clustering algorithms for across use cases to separate BEVs in\ngroups. Forte et al. [22] additional provides an overview of real-world\ncharging datasets. Nevertheless, to the best of current knowledge, no\nexisting methodology aims to reduce the overall variability of usage\nbehaviors and prioritize testing on key groups based on predictions at\nregulatory boundaries. To address this gap, a workflow is introduced\nthat divides usage behaviors into subgroups according to their influence\non battery aging. This enables engineers to select representative behaviors from relevant user groups to ensure compliance with automotive\nregulations. Depending on the application, these groups may represent\neither critical usage patterns or the majority of typical users. To the best\nof current knowledge, no comparable regulations have been established\nfor other battery applications [23], although implicit requirements\npersist through existing quality standards. Consequently, the proposed\nworkflow can be meaningfully applied to other battery domains. In general, the workflow consists of three main steps:",

      "text": "_R._ _Saam_ _et_ _al._ Regarding the structure of the paper, Section 2 provides an overview\nof relevant literature, covering approaches for predicting intersections\nwith regulatory boundaries, clustering of BEV usage data, and SoH\nestimation methods. Section 3 introduces the fleet dataset on which the\nproposed framework was developed and tested, and illustrates usage\ndifferences across five countries: China, Germany, Italy, Norway, and\nthe United States. Additionally, the openly available battery dataset\nprovided by CALCE [24] is presented. This dataset is used as a complementary source for steps where fleet data cannot be disclosed due\nto confidentiality constraints. It was selected for its variety of test\ncases [24], which resemble diverse real-world usage behaviors, and\nits strong representation in the scientific community, as highlighted in\nliterature reviews by Hasib et al. [25], dos Reis et al. [26], and Tan\net al. [27]. Section 4 elaborates on how usage behavioral patterns impact aging,\nspecifically showcasing SoH-loss differences across the five countries\nintroduced in Section 3. Section 5 details the proposed framework,\nincluding the estimation of intersections with regulatory boundaries,\ncalculation of SoH at these boundaries, and identification of representative usage groups. Each step of the framework is illustrated and\nvalidated using both the fleet dataset and the CALCE dataset. Section 6 discusses current limitations and emphasizes the modular design of the framework, which allows individual steps to be replaced\nby improved methods without altering the overall structure.

      "text": "_2.1._ _Predicting_ _intersection_ _with_ _regulatory_ _boundaries_ Predicting battery age _\ud835\udc61_ and cumulative usage _\ud835\udc62_ at regulatory boundaries has been addressed through various statistical and machine learning approaches. Geisser [28] introduced baseline statistical methods for\nforecasting problems with repeated observations, which can be adapted\nto vehicle lifetime prediction. These approaches typically assume a\ncommon mechanism underlying user behavior, such as an average daily\nmileage with deviations for holidays or day-dependent circumstances.\nWhile such assumptions simplify modeling, they may not fully capture\nreal-world variability. Similarly, linear regression offers an alternative\nfor estimating the intersection point. However, such models primarily\nrely on historical averages and long-term trends, making them insensitive to changes in driving behavior. For example, if the owner begins\ndriving substantially more kilometers per day than before, the regression model will fail to adequately adjust to this shift, as it interprets\nrecent deviations as random noise rather than a structural change in\nusage patterns. _2.2._ _Clustering_ _BEV_ _usage_ _behavioral_ _data_ Clustering is a widely used technique for grouping entities based\non similarity [29]. Algorithms can be categorized into partitioning,\nhierarchical, density-based, and other types, as discussed in the comprehensive survey by Xu and Tian [30], which lists a variety of clustering\nalgorithms and their use cases. A more recent review by Yin et al. [31] provides a concise overview of different clustering topics and\nconfirms these categorizations. Among these, K-Means [32] and Fuzzy\nC-Means [33], as originally proposed in their respective works, are\nwidely recognized clustering methods and are frequently applied in\nelectric vehicle contexts. _Energy_ _and_ _AI_ _24_ _(2026)_ _100669_ **Charging** **Behavior** **and** **Infrastructure** **Planning:** Clustering has\nbeen widely applied to analyze charging patterns and optimize infrastructure planning. For instance, Xiong et al. [34] combined clustering\nwith machine learning to predict day-ahead parking and charging of\nBEVs, enabling improved load forecasting. Similarly, M\u00e4rtz et al. [35]\nidentified user groups with similar charging behavior using K-Means,\nwhile Yang et al. [36] introduced a Fuzzy C-Means approach to handle\nuncertainty in charging patterns. Forte et al. [37] demonstrated how\nclustering charging data can optimize planning for charge point operators and energy distribution system operators. Infrastructure-related\nstudies include Bui et al. [38], who applied clustering to reduce energy\nimports during high-price periods via vehicle-to-vehicle load balancing,\nand Abdullahi et al. [39], who used clustering to determine optimal\nlocations for new charging stations.",

[41] extended\nthis approach to buses. Balaram et al. [42] focused on clustering\nprofiles to identify similarities in stay-at-home time, _Depth_ _of_ _Discharge_\n(DoD), and daily mileage. **Battery** **State** **and** **Second-Life** **Applications:** Clustering plays a\ncritical role in battery state estimation and second-life applications. Li\net al. [43] grouped cells into homogeneous modules based on performance, Ran et al. [44] clustered batteries for second-life applications, Zhang et al. [45] used _Electrochemical_ _Impedance_ _Spectroscopy_\n(EIS) features to classify performance, and Wang et al. [46] applied\nclustering to detect abnormal degradation for safe operation. Recent\nwork has extended clustering to data enrichment and second-life applications. For example, Zafar et al. [47] identified similar groups across\ntwo BEV charging datasets, one data-rich and one data-sparse, and then\napplied transfer learning to improve forecasting accuracy for the sparse\ndataset. Likewise, Liu et al. [48] proposed a framework for grouping batteries for second-life applications by using EIS and _Incremental_\n_Capacity_ _Analysis_ (ICA) to form homogeneous clusters. Comprehensive\nreviews of clustering algorithms and their applications in EV contexts\nare provided by Nazari et al. [21] and Forte et al. [22]. **Validation** **of** **Clustering** **Results:** Evaluating clustering performance is essential to ensure meaningful groupings. Two main validation approaches are commonly distinguished: _internal_ _validation_ and\n_external_ _validation_ [49]. Internal validation relies on metrics derived\nfrom the clustering inputs, such as cohesion and separation, whereas\nexternal validation compares clustering results against independent\nground truth labels. In practice, ground truth labels are often unavailable in large-scale fleet datasets, which limits the applicability of\nexternal validation and makes internal validation the default choice in\nmany studies. Liu et al. [50] provides an overview of eleven internal\nvalidation metrics, including the Calinski-Harabasz index, Silhouette\nindex, and Davies\u2013Bouldin index, while Yin et al.

      "text": "_R._ _Saam_ _et_ _al._ Building on this, Hochreiter and Schmidhuber [55] proposed the LSTM\narchitecture to address the vanishing gradient problem inherent in\ntraditional RNNs. Later, Cho et al. [56] introduced _Gated_ _Recurrent_ _Unit_\n(GRU) as a simplified alternative to LSTMs, reducing computational\ncomplexity while maintaining performance. Recent advancements have focused on improving these architectures for battery applications. For example, Arbaoui et al. [57] enhanced LSTM models for SoH prediction, achieving mean squared\nerrors of approximately 0.2 to 0.4 on high-frequency datasets. Similarly, Lee et al. [58] introduced a framework that extracts features from\ntime-series data or ICA to train machine learning architectures such as\nLSTM and Transformer models for remaining useful life prediction. **Feature** **Engineering** **and** **Hybrid** **Approaches:** In addition, Li\net al. [59] proposed a method based on features derived from ICA,\nvoltage discharge curves, and capacity degradation curves to estimate\nSoH, followed by an LSTM model for remaining useful life prediction.\nBeyond prediction, Zou et al. [60] applied machine learning to classify\ncells after production based on quality and used formation data for\nlifetime prediction. **Alternative** **and** **Non-Parametric** **Methods:** An alternative approach involves constructing a reference aging surface across a threedimensional space defined by battery age _\ud835\udc61_, cumulative usage _\ud835\udc62_, and\nSoH. While such surfaces are typically derived from laboratory measurements, they can also be estimated from fleet data when lab data\nis unavailable. Fleet-derived surfaces capture the variability necessary\nto represent real-world usage behaviors. To achieve this, RFRs can\nbe trained, combining multiple regression trees for high-dimensional\nregression tasks [61]. Random Forests have been successfully applied\nin domains such as household price prediction [62] and macroeconomic forecasting [63]. For a detailed introduction, see Breiman [61]. Alternatively, custom parameterized functions can be fitted using\nstandard non-linear optimization algorithms for constrained problems,\nas introduced by Byrd et al. [64]. _2.4._ _Motivation_ _for_ _the_ _proposed_ _framework_ While these studies provide valuable insights, they often assume\nhomogeneous usage patterns or rely on laboratory data with specialized measurements, which limits their applicability to large-scale, realworld fleets. Addressing these gaps motivates the data-driven framework introduced in this paper. By systematically integrating regulatory\nboundary prediction, SoH estimation, and behavioral clustering into\na modular, scalable pipeline, the proposed workflow connects operational behaviors with battery aging and regulatory compliance,\nenabling the derivation of test parameters and the identification of\ncritical usage patterns.",

Similar disparities occur in other parameters, such as DC\ncharging frequency (62 % for Chinese users versus 20 % for German\nusers) and daily mileage (66 km\u2215d versus 48 km\u2215d). Additional information on the fleet dataset is provided by Saam\net al. [20], including vehicle type composition, customer-selected battery sizes, and country representation. That work also reports operating differences across the same five countries for the 25th- and\n50th-percentiles. These regional differences in usage behavior, such as daily mileage\nand charging preferences, underscore the value of vehicle-generated\ndata for understanding real-world operational patterns. In this work,\n_usage_ _behavior_ refers to operational practices and conditions, including\ncharging habits, SoC ranges, and temperature exposure, among other\nfactors. A detailed discussion of behavioral patterns and their influence\non aging is provided in Section 4. To manage local storage constraints and enable meaningful analysis,\nVolkswagen aggregates raw vehicle data into standardized matrices\nduring runtime. The fleet dataset \ue232 consists of _\ud835\udc41_ vehicles, each generating multiple aggregated matrices with different formats. Each matrix\ntypically represents either a single parameter or a pair of parameters,\nallowing for efficient analysis of vehicle usage patterns. The most relevant parameters included are charge/discharge current, temperature,\nand SoC. Each matrix has a fixed shape of _\ud835\udc3c_ \u00d7 _\ud835\udc3d_ bins across all vehicles.\nIn this work, a single matrix type is considered across all _\ud835\udc41_ vehicles,\nresulting in a three-dimensional tensor: \ue232 \u2208 R _[\ud835\udc3c]_ [\u00d7] _[\ud835\udc3d]_ [\u00d7] _[\ud835\udc41]_",

Due to this\nmanual retrieval process, no fixed sampling rate is applied, resulting\nin inhomogeneous time intervals both within individual vehicles and\nacross the fleet. Due to the sensitivity of the fleet dataset, some steps of the methodology are evaluated using an additional, openly available battery lifetime dataset from CALCE [24].

The cells were divided into 24 distinct groups, each\nwith different test parameters, and each group consists of eight newly\nmanufactured unique cells. Various ambient temperatures ranging from\n10 \u00b0C to 60 \u00b0C were applied. Discharge C-rates varied between 0 _._ 7 C and\n2 C, while constant current charging was typically performed at 1 _._ 5 C\nacross most of the SoC range.

In contrast to the Volkswagen AG dataset, the CALCE dataset is\nprovided in a time-series format, including parameters such as test\ntime, applied current, charged and discharged capacity, and a cycle\ncounter. The dataset is split into multiple individual files spanning\nacross different DUTs and test cycles. Each DUT is assigned a unique\nID composed of the test group and the cell number: DUT ID \u2236 test group \u2212 cell number For further details on the dataset and the experimental design,\nplease refer to Pecht and Osterman [24].

For instance, von B\u00fclow [16] provides an\noverview of stressors, defined as combinations of operational conditions that induce or accelerate aging. Vermeer et al.

Broussely et al. [13] contributed foundational insights into the distinction between cyclic and calendar aging\nmechanisms. Schreiber et al. [18] explored the impact of different\ndriving profiles, such as highway versus commuter scenarios, on longterm battery health, showing that highway profiles with higher C-rates\ncan lead to up to four times faster degradation. Additionally, Geslin\net al. [19] highlighted increased longevity when dynamic cycling is\napplied compared to constant current profiles. Fig. 2 illustrates several\nusage-specific parameters and their connection to internal battery aging\nphenomena. The aging causes shown in Fig. 2 affect battery degradation in\ndifferent ways.

[15]. [72] demonstrated how different cell chemistries and vendors impact\ndegradation, while Dubarry et al. [73] analyzed the influence of chemistry on calendar aging. Arunachala [74] investigated cell geometry\nand sizing, showing that larger cells accelerate aging. However, these\naspects are not further explored in this work, as they are not directly\ninfluenced by customer usage behavior. Independent of chemistry and\ngeometry, battery aging can be broadly categorized into two types:\ncalendar aging, which occurs over time (e.g., when the vehicle is\nparked), and cyclic aging, which results from active usage. Calendar\naging typically dominates due to long idle periods, as Nobis and Kuhnimhof [75] reported an average daily driving distance of only 40 km per\nvehicle in Germany. Saam et al. [20] found that among five countries,\nChinese customers in the 75th-percentile drive the most (66 km\u2215d),\nwhile German customers drive the least (48 km\u2215d). In contrast, cyclic\naging is heavily influenced by driving behavior. Schreiber et al. [18]\ndemonstrated this by comparing six distinct driving profiles, showing\nthat highway scenarios with higher C-rates lead to significantly faster\ndegradation. Additionally, Guo and Chen [76] showed that the DoD\nplays a critical role in battery longevity, with higher DoDs leading to\nshorter service life. Building on these observations, usage behavior emerges as a key\ndriver of aging variability. In real-world applications, a wide variety of\nusage behaviors, or behavioral patterns, exists, each influencing battery\ndegradation in distinct ways. In the context of this work, behavioral\npatterns refer to specific operational practices and conditions under\nwhich a vehicle is used. These include, for example, DoD, ambient\ntemperature exposure, and charging habits (e.g., fast vs. slow charging).\nEach of these parameters contributes to the rate and nature of battery\ndegradation, particularly in terms of capacity fade over time. The combination of these parameters constitutes a unique behavioral pattern.\nFig. 3 illustrates the impact of usage differences (as shown in Fig. 1) on\nbattery aging. It can be observed that vehicles in China exhibit slower\ndegradation compared to the overall fleet, whereas vehicles in Italy and\nthe United States experience an accelerated decline in SoH.",

      "text": "Given that capacity fade is a key indicator of battery aging, these\nusage-specific parameters are critical in determining whether a vehicle\nremains within the SoH thresholds mandated by regulatory authorities.\nAccordingly, behavioral patterns can be broadly categorized into two\ngroups: those that are relevant for a recall and those that are not.\nPatterns relevant for a recall are typically associated with accelerated\naging, potentially causing a vehicle to exceed SoH thresholds before\nreaching its expected service life or mileage. The following condition outlines the scenarios in which a vehicle either complies with or\nviolates the regulatory requirements: ComplyRegulation =Indicates if a single vehicle has any relevance for a recall\nSoHRegulation =SoH threshold given by the respective regulation which is currently at 70 % for the Euro\n7 and the ACCII\nSoHVehicle =SoH of vehicle _n_\nMileageVehicle =Traveled mileage of vehicle _n_\nMileageRegulation =Threshold mileage by the respective regulation (e.g. 160 _,_ 000 km for Euro 7 and\n240 _,_ 000 km for ACCII)\nAgeVehicle =Age of vehicle _n_\nAgeRegulation =Threshold age by the respective regulation\n(e.g. 8 years for Euro 7 and 10 years for ACCII) To reduce the likelihood of a fleet-wide recall, vehicle manufacturers must design battery testing procedures that accurately reflect\nreal-world usage. Currently, the standard approach involves applying\nfast charging and discharging profiles, commonly referred to as the\n\u2018\u2018highway scenario\u2019\u2019 by Lienkamp [17] and Schreiber et al. [18]. This\nmethod is the fastest way to simulate the energy throughput required\nto meet regulatory mileage targets while still adhering to the technical\nlimitations of the battery cells. However, this approach has limitations.\nIn real-world conditions, such as those represented by the \u2018\u2018commuter\nscenario\u2019\u2019 in the same studies, the service life of batteries is significantly\noverachieved. According to Lienkamp [17] and Schreiber et al. [18],\nthe difference in degradation rates between these scenarios can exceed\na factor of four. In their experiments, batteries reached a SoH of 70 %\nafter 375 _,_ 000 km in the highway scenario, whereas linear extrapolation\npredicts the same SoH threshold would only be reached after approximately 1.58 million km in the commuter scenario.

On one hand, designing batteries to meet SoH thresholds under\nhighway testing conditions is not financially sustainable for manufacturers, as it requires higher-quality components that increase retail\nprices and may deter customers. On the other hand, it is environmentally unsustainable because many batteries are recycled prematurely\ndue to vehicle scrapping, even though they have not reached the end\nof their service life. Therefore, a new testing methodology is needed,\none that more accurately reflects real-world driving scenarios. In this\nwork, a framework is introduced that enables manufacturers to identify critical usage behaviors that significantly accelerate aging. This\napproach provides a foundation for developing test cases that better\nrepresent real-world conditions and ensure compliance with regulatory\nrequirements across the relevant portion of the vehicle fleet. **5.** **Methodology** The motivation for identifying key usage patterns arises from observed regional differences in vehicle operation, as illustrated in Fig.\n1, and their impact on aging shown in Fig. 3. Further details on these\nregional differences are provided by Saam et al. [20]. Such differences\nand their influence on aging highlight the need for a framework that\ncan isolate usage patterns contributing to battery degradation, independent of geographic or operational context. Unlike most existing studies,\na data-driven approach is adopted that does not rely on historical\nload profiles. This choice reflects a different objective: using SoH\nestimates to identify similar usage groups and, consequently, derive\nrepresentative load profiles. While this manuscript focuses on developing such a framework, the empirical basis for regional variability\nis well established in prior work; see the sources in Section 4. The\npresent implementation uses comparatively simple, well-established\nmethods as illustrative building blocks. These are not proposed as\noptimal algorithms but as exchangeable components within a modular\nworkflow that can be upgraded with more sophisticated techniques in\nfuture work.",

This limitation arises because\nthey do not account for the presence of faulty cells in the battery\nor aging phenomena that cause capacity and power fade. Therefore,\na comparison with matrices of the same type from other vehicles is necessary to isolate vehicle-specific aging effects and identify outliers\nor anomalies. This comparison is performed using the framework illustrated in\nFig. 4, which identifies usage behaviors based on available fleet data\nthat lead to similar battery aging. The framework consists of multiple\nsteps. Before identifying these usage behaviors, preliminary actions\nmust be taken to ensure a reliable data basis for the algorithms. These\nactions include minimizing corrupted data and outliers, reducing noise,\nand ensuring a homogeneous data format. These steps are represented\nby _Data_ _Cleansing_ and _Feature_ _Engineering_ . For the Volkswagen AG\ndataset \ue232, the following steps were performed: For the CALCE dataset \ue22f, a different set of steps was required due\nto its structure and characteristics. These steps are as follows: - Combining individual files per DUT/subcycles into a single file spanning the entire DUT test duration. - Converting raw data into an aggregated matrix format to establish a similar data structure compared to the Volkswagen AG dataset\n\ue232 . - Calculating SoH degradation using: CapacityDischargeCycle= _\ud835\udc56_\nSoHCycle= _\ud835\udc56_ = CapacityDischargeCycle=0 \u22c5 100 _._ - Filtering out SoH outliers (SoH \u2264 0 %). Further details are omitted due to their application-specific nature and the absence of a standardized process applicable to other\nuse cases [79]. For guidance in selecting suitable algorithms for a\ngiven dataset, the surveys by Hodge and Austin [79] and Souiden\net al. [80] offer comprehensive overviews of techniques and example\nalgorithms. Hodge and Austin [79] discusses approaches such as statistical methods, neural networks, machine learning techniques, and\nhybrid systems that combine at least two of these methods. In contrast, Souiden et al. [80] provides a literature review focused on\nanomaly detection in high-dimensional datasets and identifies current\nlimitations in this area. Subsequently, Section 5.1 introduces an approach for predicting the\nbattery age _\ud835\udc61_ and cumulative usage _\ud835\udc62_ at which the vehicle intersects the\nregulatory boundaries.

For example, a vehicle with an SoH of\n71 % after five years and 100 _,_ 000 km would currently comply with all\nregulations. However, it is likely to fall below the SoH threshold of 70 %\nbefore reaching eight years or 160 _,_ 000 km, as required by the European\nCommission under the Euro 7 regulation [6]. Therefore, a new parameter is needed to represent compliance at the regulatory targets. This\ncan be achieved by leveraging the existing protocol metadata for each\nvehicle.

This represents an extreme case within\nthe dataset. None of these 3500 vehicles has exceeded the eight-year\nage boundary, as MEB vehicles have only been in production since late\n2019 [65]. However, all of them have already surpassed the mileage\nregulation. Fig. 6 illustrates the distribution of regulation boundary\nintersections for this extreme subsample, showing that most vehicles\nintersect the mileage boundary between 1.5 and 4 years. Due to the low sampling frequency, caused by long intervals between workshop visits, these intersections are estimated based on\nthe last data point below _\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc56<_ Regulation\u2227 _\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc56<_ Regulation and the first data\npoint above _\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc56_ \u2265Regulation\u2228 _\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc56_ \u2265Regulation. To reach such high mileage in\na relatively short time, these vehicles must have traveled more than\n35 _,_ 000 km annually. This places them in an extreme usage category, especially considering that 95 % of the fleet travels less than\n32 _,_ 000 km annually and 75 % travels less than 20 _,_ 000 km, based on the\navailable protocol data. It is important to note that these 3500 vehicles do not constitute a\nrepresentative sample of the entire fleet but rather highlight edge cases\nwith unusually high usage intensity.",

In contrast to the extreme subsample, Fig. 7 presents a fleet-wide\nprediction of regulation boundary intersections. Here, the peak observed in the subsample shifts toward the center of the plot, corresponding to an age of eight years and a mileage of 160 _,_ 000 km. The overall fleet prediction exhibits a primary peak at approximately 112 _,_ 000 km,\nhighlighted in red. A secondary peak at 0 km results from protocols\ngenerated prior to vehicle delivery, for which no subsequent data is\navailable. While the fleet-wide prediction in Fig. 7 suggests that most vehicles\nwill intersect regulatory boundaries around eight years, this estimate\nis based on extrapolation and carries inherent limitations. Specifically,\nthe methodology assumes stable usage behavior over time and does\nnot account for drastic changes, such as those caused by vehicle resale\nor special operating conditions (e.g., rental or company cars). For\ncontext, as of 2024, Germany had approximately 330,000 rental or carsharing vehicles, representing only 0 _._ 67 % of all passenger vehicles [81].\nFurthermore, leasing contracts in Europe typically end after three to\nfour years [82], and in Germany, 13 _._ 5 % of all ownership transfers involve vehicles younger than two years [82]. Such factors can introduce\ndeviations in the predicted intersections. These deviations are illustrated in Fig. 8, ranging from \u221231 % to 12 %\nfor 95 % of the data when comparing predicted intersections to observed\nprotocol points. However, when considering the entire intersection\nrange, deviations reduce significantly to between \u221211 % to 4 %. For 75 %\nof the data, the relative error narrows further to \u22126 % to 3 _._ 5 %, and\nfor 50 %, to \u22122 % to 1 %. It is important to note that these deviations\nmay be slightly affected by the absence of ground truth for the exact\nintersection points, primarily due to large time gaps between protocol\nentries. _5.1.2._ _Application_ _to_ _the_ _CALCE_ _dataset_ The regulation boundaries defined by Euro-7 or ACCII are not\napplicable to the CALCE dataset due to its fundamentally different\nuse case (automotive operation versus laboratory testing).

This fractionation\nensures that the performance of the methodology can be assessed under progressively reduced data conditions. To mitigate sampling bias, each fraction was drawn randomly, and the procedure was repeated 30 times for every combination of cutoff and fraction parameters. The results were then averaged to obtain robust performance estimates. Fig. 9 shows the number of correct predictions for different cutoff and fraction combinations and thereby illustrates the resulting perfor\nmance trends. Notably, accuracy improvements beyond 50 % of the age and cycle boundaries were marginal. Furthermore, as little as 10 % of the dataset truncated at 50 % of the boundaries was sufficient to achieve an accuracy of approximately 95 %.

To train the RFR,\na standard dataset split of 80 % for training and 20 % for testing is\nemployed [83,84] to mitigate overfitting. Before training, outliers and anomalies in the SoH progression must\nbe removed; otherwise, the predictions of the RFR would be skewed.\nThis outlier removal process was performed earlier in the workflow\n(see Section 5). Once the dataset was cleansed, the RFR is trained to\ngenerate the reference aging surface. Following training, the model approximates an unknown function\n_\ud835\udc53_ ( _\ud835\udc61, \ud835\udc62_ ) that maps battery age _\ud835\udc61_ and cumulative usage _\ud835\udc62_ to the SoH: _\ud835\udc53_ ( _\ud835\udc61, \ud835\udc62_ ) \u2248 SoH( _\ud835\udc61, \ud835\udc62_ ) _._ However, in some cases, the resulting surface does not exhibit\nmonotonic decrease as required by Eq. (1). This is problematic because a non-monotonic trend contradicts the typical SoH progression\nof lithium-ion batteries [85]. can be estimated. Depending on which boundary is reached first, this\ncorresponds to: _\u0303\ud835\udc53_ ( _\ud835\udc61_ est _, \ud835\udc62_ Regulation) _,_ _\u0303\ud835\udc53_ ( _\ud835\udc61_ Regulation _, \ud835\udc62_ est) _,_ or _\u0303\ud835\udc53_ ( _\ud835\udc61_ Regulation _, \ud835\udc62_ Regulation) _._ However, these values would only represent the true SoH for a\nvehicle if all previous protocol entries _\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc56_ perfectly aligned with the\naging surface, i.e., \u2200 _\ud835\udc56_ \u2208{1 _,_ \u2026 _, \ud835\udc5b_ } _,_ _\ud835\udeff\ud835\udc56_ = _\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc56_ SoH \u2212 _\ud835\udc53_ _[\u0303]_ ( _\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc56, \ud835\udc62\ud835\udc56_ ) = 0 _,_",

These methods typically require\nlow C-rates and controlled laboratory conditions, which are unavailable\nin large-scale fleet data. In this study, a 80/20 train-validation split was applied, consistent\nwith prior works [83,84]. To minimize bias from a single partition, the\ntraining data was randomly shuffled at each epoch, ensuring diverse\nsample exposure during optimization. This strategy provides a practical\nbalance between computational efficiency and reliable generalization\nassessment. The MLP model uses the current feature vector _\ud835\udc5f_ ( _\ud835\udc61, \ud835\udc62_ ) and\nits corresponding SoH( _\ud835\udc5f_ ( _\ud835\udc61, \ud835\udc62_ )) to predict the next SoH given the subsequent _\ud835\udc5f_ ( _\ud835\udc61, \ud835\udc62_ ). In contrast, the recurrent architectures, RNN, LSTM, and\nGRU, leverage the previous nine feature vectors and their associated\nSoH( _\ud835\udc5f_ ( _\ud835\udc61, \ud835\udc62_ )) values to predict the next SoH using the tenth _\ud835\udc5f_ ( _\ud835\udc61, \ud835\udc62_ ). For\nvehicles or DUTs with fewer than ten samples, missing entries are zeropadded to ensure that all input sequences have a consistent length. The\ninput\u2013output structure is illustrated in Fig. 11. To identify the most suitable architecture, a hyperparameter search\nis conducted. Rather than performing an exhaustive search, a pragmatic\napproach is adopted by executing 10 runs per model for each of the two\ndatasets \ue232 and \ue22f. This strategy balances computational efficiency with\nsufficient exploration of the hyperparameter space. Table 4 summarizes the best-performing hyperparameter configurations identified during the search for datasets \ue232 and \ue22f.

Percentiles are reported instead of\nmean errors to provide a robust measure of performance across the\ndistribution and reduce sensitivity to outliers. For both datasets, _\ud835\udc54_ 1 exhibits the weakest performance, which is\nexpected given its baseline functionality. However, within \ue232, the performance gap is smaller than in \ue22f, likely due to the more homogeneous\naging behavior in \ue232 .

Similarly,\n_\ud835\udc54_ 2 surpasses _\ud835\udc53_ 1 by over 1 _._ 6 %. The superior performance of machine\nlearning models on \ue22f is likely due to its higher sampling frequency,\nwhich provides a larger quantity of training samples.

They can capture non-linear relationships, account for variability in mileage patterns, and adapt to evolving behaviors, making them better suited for predicting intersections under\ndiverse and dynamic conditions.

Without such features, even\nadvanced models may struggle to provide reliable predictions.",

      "text": "In addition, the sampling rate of available data plays a critical\nrole in prediction accuracy. Higher sampling frequencies enable models\nto capture short-term fluctuations and emerging trends, improving\nthe precision of intersection forecasts. Conversely, low sampling rates\ncan obscure these dynamics, leading to delayed detection of critical\nchanges and reduced reliability in long-term predictions. Enhancing\ndata acquisition strategies, for example through _Over_ _The_ _Air_ (OTA)based solutions, could therefore significantly strengthen the predictive\ncapability of both statistical and machine learning approaches. _6.2._ _Limitations_ _in_ _estimating_ _the_ _state_ _of_ _health_ The influence of low sampling rates on SoH estimation is clearly\nvisible in the Volkswagen AG fleet dataset \ue232 . Compared to the CALCE\ndataset \ue22f, which provides measurements at a higher sampling frequency, the performance differences between estimation methods, particularly for recurrent networks, can reach several percentage points.\nThis highlights that the framework benefits significantly from higher\nsampling rates in fleet operations, for example by leveraging OTA\nsolutions to retrieve data automatically on a day-to-day basis. Another aspect concerns the handling of knee points in the degradation curve. These abrupt changes in aging behavior, often occurring\nnear the end of life, are not yet explicitly modeled in the current\napproach. Addressing knee points in future work could improve predictions of remaining useful life and ensure compliance with regulatory\nboundaries, particularly for batteries approaching critical thresholds. Additionally, during training of the models (RFR, MLP, RNN, LSTM,\nGRU) only a 80/20 train-validation split has been applied. To further\nreduce bias from a single partitioning and enhance robustness, incorporating K-fold cross validation would be beneficial. While this approach\nincreases computational requirements for large datasets, it represents a\npromising avenue for improving model reliability as resources allow. Finally, the full potential of machine learning models is currently\nlimited by the low sampling frequency and the absence of specialized represented by min( _\ud835\udc67_ ( _\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc44, \ud835\udc62\ud835\udc44_ ) _\ud835\udc5a_ )), Intersection at ( _\ud835\udc61_ Regulation _, \ud835\udc62\ud835\udc44_ ) represented by max( _\ud835\udc67_ ( _\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc44, \ud835\udc62\ud835\udc44_ ) _\ud835\udc5a_ )), Fig. 13, represented by min(| _\ud835\udc67_ ( _\ud835\udc61, \ud835\udc62_ ) _\ud835\udc5a_ |)).",

In practice, this assumption rarely holds: daily mileage can\nvary due to seasonal changes, holidays, or shifts in commuting patterns.\nFurthermore, abrupt changes caused by vehicle resale or ownership\ntransfer introduce discontinuities that these models cannot capture. Another limitation is sensitivity to outliers, such as occasional longdistance trips or extended periods of inactivity, which can distort\npredictions. 15",

Differences in charging behavior lead to distinct aging outcomes: _\ud835\udc3a_ 2 and _\ud835\udc3a_ 3 exhibit less aging compared to _\ud835\udc3a_ 1, which\nhas an average SoH of 78 %, whereas _\ud835\udc3a_ 3 and _\ud835\udc3a_ 2 reach 92 % and\n97 %, respectively.

      "text": "_R._ _Saam_ _et_ _al._ While the current approach uses single-view clustering based solely\non one usage behavior, such as charging behavior, this representation\nis inherently limited. It risks overlooking other influential dimensions,\nincluding discharge patterns, temperature, and rest periods, which can\nlead to biased group formation and incomplete insights into aging\nmechanisms. Consequently, an improved approach may be required\ndepending on the use case, one that considers multiple dimensions of\nusage behavior. A promising solution is an extension of the current\nframework by incorporating a multi-view clustering approach, where\neach view represents a distinct aspect of usage. For instance, one view\ncould capture charging behavior at different C-rates, another could\nrepresent discharge C-rates, and a third could include rest time at\nspecific temperatures and SoC intervals. Such a framework enables a\nmore comprehensive distinction between usage patterns and a more\naccurate assessment of their influence on aging.

To guide methodological extensions, the framework provides clear\nmodular interfaces. Future work could incorporate survival analysis\nor deep learning models for intersection prediction, integrate kneepoint detection for improved SoH estimation, or adopt multi-view\nclustering to capture complex behavioral patterns.

A data-driven framework\nwas introduced to predict battery age _\ud835\udc61_ and cumulative usage _\ud835\udc62_ at\nintersections with regulatory boundaries, estimate SoH at these points,\nand cluster vehicles into representative aging groups. Validation on\nthe Volkswagen AG fleet and _Center_ _for_ _Advanced_ _Life_ _Cycle_ _Engi-_\n_neering_ (CALCE) datasets achieved clustering scores of _Homogeneity_\n0.9157 and _Completeness_ 0.9509. Unlike software frameworks providing\nimplemented modular components, this work conceptually integrates\nestablished techniques, regulatory boundary prediction, SoH estimation, and behavioral clustering, into a cohesive analytical pipeline. This\nintegration enables comprehensive analysis linking battery aging to\nusage behavior and regulatory compliance, facilitating interpretability\nand adaptability to evolving operational and regulatory contexts. While the methodology shows strong potential, limitations such as\nreliance on single-view clustering and sensitivity to sampling frequency\nremain. Future work should incorporate multi-view clustering to capture multiple dimensions of usage behavior (e.g., charging, discharging,\nrest time or temperature), knee-point detection for improved lifetime\nprediction, and advanced machine learning models for intersection\nestimation.
